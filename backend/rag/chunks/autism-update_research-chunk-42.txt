significant (improvement of 4 points in younger children and 5 in older). Finally, a poor quality UK study 79 , 80 compared the long-term effects (2 years post-treatment) of 1:1 home-based early intervention (both university-provided and privately-provided) to community-based treatment-as-usual, including PECS, TEACCH, and medication. The early intervention group included 23 children (mean age=35.7±4 months; mean IQ=61.43±16.43 months), and the community-based group included 18 (mean age=38.4±4.4 months; mean IQ=62.33±16.64) at the two-year followup, with children in the community-based group significantly older at the start of treatment (p< .05). For 24 months, children in the early intervention group received an average of 25.6 hours/week of ABA-based intervention using discrete trial training in the home environment, whereas children in the community-based arm received an unspecified amount of eclectic treatment. After 24 months of intervention, IQ, mental age, and language comprehension/expression improved significantly for the ABA group versus community- based (p ≤.05; effect size for IQ change=0.77). At the two year foll owup, IQ gains were only maintained for children who received privately-provided ABA-based intervention. IQ remained stable for children in the community-based group and significantly declined for children who received university-provided intervention (effect size=.49). This result is confounded by nonrandom assignment and the fact that at baseline, the university-based group had higher levels of ASD symptoms, lower levels of adaptive behavior, and fewer total intervention hours. 23 Table 6. Key outcomes of ABA-based early intervention studies Author, Year, Country Groups, N Enrollment/N Final Study Quality Age, Mean Months±SD IQ, Mean±SD Key Outcomes Peters - Scheffer et al. 2013 91 Netherlands G1: Low intensity Lovaas- based intervention+specialized preschool, 20/20 G2: Specialized preschool, 20/20 Quality: Good G1+G2: 62.52±16.96 (median) G1: 40.66±20.1 G2: 40.14±18.3 • 9/20 participants in G1 received 1 year of treatment vs. 2 years • Developmental age in both groups improved over time, but increase was greater in G1 vs. G2 (p=.001); effect size for change=1.09 • IQ improved significantly from baseline to 12 months (mean 40.66 to 48.17, P<.001) in G1 and remained stable from 12-24 months; no significant change over time in G2 (baseline mean=40.14, 24-month mean=39.42); effect size for change=0.40 • Total Vineland and subscale scores improved in both groups with greater improvements in G1 vs. G2 (p values<.001); effect size for change in total score=1.74 • Receptive language improved at 24 months in G1 vs. G2 (p=.04); expressive language improve over time in both groups but between group differences at 24 months were not significant (effect size for change=0.40) • Both groups generally improved over time on Early Social Communication Scales domains but between group differences were not significant at 24 months • Severity ratings (CARS, ADOS) decreased significantly over time for G1 but not G2; effect size for change in ADOS=1.51, CARS=1.50) • Differences between groups in measures of emotional and behavioral problems and behavioral flexibility were not significant • More G1 participants achieved clinical and reliable significant on developmental age, adaptive behavior, interpersonal relationships, play and leisure time, receptive and expressive language, ASD severity, and responding
