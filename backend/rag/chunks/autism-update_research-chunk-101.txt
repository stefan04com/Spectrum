on social outcomes for school aged children with ASD is low. All studies demonstrated benefit on at least one outcome measure, but a lack of consistency in the interventions or measures used makes it difficult to assess consistency or precision. Most studies relied on parent or teacher report of intermediate outcomes, although some studies have attempted to included ratings and outcomes (peer/teacher nominations, social networks/maps) with potential for assessment of generalization (Table 14). 86 Table 14.

Maintenance and generalization of these skills beyond the treatment context had variable results. Social skills interventions varied widely in terms of scope and intensity. nRCT = nonrandomized controlled trial; RCT = randomized controlled trial 87 Play- /Interaction-Focused Studies Studies incorporating play or interaction-based elements have targeted either joint attention skills, early imitation skills, or focused play in younger children. No studies reported harms of intervention. Since our previous review, which included seven (reported in nine publications) comparative studies (two RCTs of fair 139-141 and five of poor 142-147 quality) addressing play- or interaction-based approaches, there have been substantially more studies of well-controlled joint attention interventions across a range of intervention settings (e.g., clinician, parent, teacher delivered). Regarding joint attention skills, interventions were delivered by parents, teachers, and interventionists over typically s hort durations (≤ 12 weeks). Three studies reported longer -term followup (≥12 months). 140 , 141 , 148-150 , 156 As with other studies reported in this review, participants in play/interaction studies often received other early intervention services in addition to the targeted intervention, making disentangling effects of the intervention difficult. This growing evidence base supports positive effects for young and preschool children with ASD, particularly when targeting joint attention skills themselves as well as related social communication and language skills. Although joint attention intervention studies certainly demonstrated changes within this theoretically important domain, data are more limited about their ability to improve broad developmental skills (such as cognition, adaptive behavior, and ASD symptom severity) beyond communication and language gains over time. Specific and focal training regarding imitation skills utilizing naturalistic approaches to promote imitation (i.e., Reciprocal Imitation Training) has shown positive results in improving not only imitation skills, but potentially other social communication skills such as joint attention as well. 152 , 153 Additional ly, parent training in a variety of play-based interventions is associated with positive outcomes for encouraging early social communication skills (e.g., joint attention, engagement, play interactions), play skills, and early language skills. 154 , 156 , 160 Strength of the Evidence A growing evidence base reports on effects in children
