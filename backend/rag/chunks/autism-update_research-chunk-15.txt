fair (76) Prospective cohort: 7 fair, 2 poor (616) nRCT: 1 good, 4 fair (170) Retrospective cohort: 1 fair, 2 poor (182) Study limitations: Medium Consistency: Inconsistent Directness: Direct Precision: Imprecise Reporting bias: Undetected Other concerns: Behavior was always measured by parent report (Vineland Scales of Adaptive Behavior) rather than objective observation. Most studies found that children in both treatment and control groups improved on adaptive skills. However, children in early intensive behavioral interventions improved more than children receiving other types of services. Not all group differences were maintained over long-term followup Therefore, SOE was low for a positive effect relative to eclectic controls. Symptom severity Low for positive effect RCT: 1 good, 1 fair (332) nRCT: 1 good, 1 fair (74) Prospective cohort: 4 fair, 2 poor (470) Retrospective cohort: 1 fair (142) Study limitations: Medium Consistency: Inconsistent Directness: Direct Precision: Imprecise Reporting bias: Undetected Other concerns: Most control groups were also receiving treatments and also showed improvement, making it difficult to tease apart the effect of intervention. There was mixed impact on symptom severity. SOE is low for a positive effect on symptom severity because 2 good-quality studies showed positive effects but multiple lower quality studies did not. More studies are needed to confirm results. ES-12 Table B.

Most studies found a positive effect of treatment on language/communication skills, although the specific domain of improvement (e.g., receptive vs. expressive language) varied across study. Some initial between-group differences disappeared at long-term followup There is moderate SOE of a positive effect on language overall. Social skills/social behavior Low for positive effect RCT: 1 good, 1 fair (332) nRCT: 1 fair (34) Prospective cohort: 4 fair, 1 poor (406) Retrospective cohort: 1 fair (142) Study limitations: Medium Consistency: Inconsistent Directness: Direct Precision: Imprecise Reporting bias: Undetected Other concerns: Social skills were assessed almost exclusively using parent- reported standard scores on the Vineland Scales of Adaptive Behavior. Many studies found that treatment groups improved more than controls on measures of social skills, although a significant minority did not find any treatment effect. SOE is low for a positive effect at this time because, although positive effects were observed, they were not consistent. ES-13 Table B.
