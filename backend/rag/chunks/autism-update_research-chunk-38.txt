60 , 61 , 63 and one poor quality 62 ), and two were poor quality retrospective cohort studies. 58 , 59 For the current review we identified 25 comparative studies (reported in 37 publications) meeting our inclusion criteria and evaluating either ABA-based early intervention approaches 73 , 76-91 or approaches integrating parent training components). 72 , 92-109 Four of these studies (published in multiple papers) report followup data for studies reported in the 2011 review. 72 , 73 , 79 , 80 , 85-90 , 105 , 110 Additionally, one study in the current report 95 may include some participants reported in studies in the 2011 review. 111 , 112 ABA-based approaches. Ten studies (reported in 18 publications) assessed ABA-based early intensive behavioral and developmental intervention (Table 6). 73 , 76-88 , 90 , 91 , 110 , 113 Studies included two RCTs conducted in the United States; 73 , 84 , 85 two non-randomized controlled trials conducted in Europe; 76 , 91 three European, 77-80 one U.S.-based, 83 and one Israeli 81 prospective cohort study; and one Canadian retrospective cohort study that reported on segments of the same population in multiple publications. 86-90 , 110 Five studies compared ABA-based approaches to 19 care-as-usual community therapies 73 , 78 , 79 , 81 , 85 , 86 and five to preschool-based programs. 76 , 77 , 83 , 84 , 91 Mean participant age ranged from 15-72 months. Treatment duration ranged from 6 to 24 months. We rated two studies as good, seven studies as fair, and one study as poor quality. Parent training. We identified 15 studies (reported in 19 publications) of early intervention with parent training components (Table 7). 72 , 92-109 Studies included five European 95 , 97 , 101 , 102 , 108 and one Australian 100 prospective cohort studies; four RCTs conducted in the United States or Canada, 93 , 98 , 103 , 104 , 107 , 109 two (including one crossover) in Asia, 92 , 99 one in Australia, 96 and two (one with suboptimal randomization) in Europe. 72 , 94 , 105 Seven studies compared parent training to treatment as usual (community-based intervention). 72 , 92 -, 9 4, 98 , 101 , 102 , 105 - 107 Five compared ABA-based parent training to other parent-training paradigms 97 , 100 , 103 , 104 , 108 , 109 or multiple other interventions, 95 , 96 and the comparison arm in one study received no specific intervention. 99 Mean participant age ranged from 14 to 81 months. Treatment duration ranged from 12 weeks to 2 years. We rated six studies as good, six studies as fair, and three studies as poor quality. Detailed Analysis ABA-Based Approaches One fair quality RCT examined the use of the Learning Experiences and Alternative Program for Preschoolers and Their Parents (LEAP) protocol in preschool classrooms in the United States. 84 The study compared 27 classrooms (n children=177; mean age: 50.1 months±4.6 months) with teachers trained in the
