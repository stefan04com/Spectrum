pretend play, imitation, or child/parent communication. Detailed Analysis Studies Addressing Joint Attention Outcomes A fair quality pilot RCT evaluating a teacher-implemented joint attention intervention randomized child-teacher dyads in public preschools to either intervention (n=9 children, mean child age=46 ±5 months, mean mental age=30.3 ±5.01 months) or wait list control (n=7, mean age=43.01±6 months, mean mental age=33.8±8.74 months). 157 The manualized JASP/ER (Joint Attention and Symbolic Play/Engagement and Regulation) intervention trained teachers in eleven key strategies including setting up the environment, following the child’s lead, imitating the child’s play action, contingent language, and modeling joint attention. Teachers received a 1- hour training workshop and 1-hour of individual training with the child from a JASP/ER interventionist per week. Interventionists also instructed teachers to use JASP/ER strategies daily. At the 5-week followup, children in the intervention group improved in total initiations of joint attention and in pointing compared with the control arm (p<.005) and in showing (p<.01) in classroom observations (large effect sizes for each measure, 1.85 to 2.02). Groups did not differ on measures of looking or giving. Most scores on the Early Social Communication Scales joint attention measures and frequency of joint attention initiations in videotaped interactions did not differ significantly between groups. Object engagement declined and supported engagement improved in the treatment group compared with control (large effect sizes, d=1.24 to 1.41, p≤.05). Observations of teachers also demonstrated increased use of JASP/ER strategies in the treatment arm. In another good quality pilot RCT of JASP/ER, investigators randomized minimally verbal (<10 spontaneous functional communicative words) preschoolers enrolled in intensive ABA- based interventions for at least 12 months to either JASP/ER or control (standard intensive preschool, n=8, mean age=54.68±10.25, mean mental age=13.91±3.85). 151 Treatment group participants (n=7, mean age=48.73±11.68 months, mean mental age=17.21±3.91 months) received 1-hour of JASP/ER training per week in addition to the intensive preschool. At the 3- month followup, the JASP/ER group increased in play types and decreased time unengaged significantly from baseline (p=.04). Changes were not significant for the control group. The JASP/ER group also spent less time disengaged during class observations compared with the control group (effect size=1.63, p=.05), initiated more requesting gestures (effect size=1.51, p=.01) and evidenced more diversity of spontaneous play (effect size=0.81, p=.04). Groups did not differ on Early Social Communication Scales variables related to joint attention. Another fair quality RCT 155 conducted in 59 Norwegian preschools over 8 weeks evaluated a manualized adaptation of a joint attention intervention reported below. 140 , 141 , 148 , 149 Children in the intervention group (n=34, mean age=47.6±8.30 months, DQ=53.3±19.2) attended regular or 49 specialized ASD preschools and also received up to 80 sessions (20 minutes twice daily, 5 days/week) of intervention focused on promoting joint attention and engagement within play activities. Children in the control group (n=27, age=50.3±8.3 months, DQ=59.9±19.7) also attended regular or specialized preschools. Groups did not differ in number of preschool hours or 1:1 training or support. The control group had greater expressive language age at baseline compared with the treatment group
