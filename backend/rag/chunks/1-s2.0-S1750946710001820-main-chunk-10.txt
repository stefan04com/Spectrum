object/activity related themes (e.g., sports and hobbies). T.T. Rivet, J.L. Matson / Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders 5 (2011) 957–976 959 Less research has addressed gender differences in restricted interests and repetitive behavior. In typically developing children (8–72 months), Evans, Leckman, Carter, and Reznick (1997) did not find significant differences in compulsions, routines, and rituals. In typically developing 2-year olds, Leekam et al. (2007) found boys had greater overall repetitive behavior, and preoccupations with restricted patterns of interest. Koenig and Tsatsanis (2005) cited evidence indicating greater difficulties with self-regulation and inhibition control in boys, hypothesizing that if repetitive behavior in ASD serves to reduce arousal or provide sensory stimulation, girls may have less difficulty decreasing reliance on these behaviors (Koenig & Tsatsanis, 2005). 4. Gender differences in ASD 4.1. Intelligence (IQ) 4.1.1. Gender differences in IQ in ASD Early on in epidemiological studies and the literature, differences regarding intelligence consistently emerged. In the first epidemiological study, Lotter (1966) found that 100% of girls ( n = 9) had an IQ score below 55 compared to 57% of boys ( n = 13), a sex ratio of 1.4:1. In a review of epidemiological studies, Fombonne (2005) found a median sex ratio of 5.5:1 with IQ in the normal range, compared to 1.95:1 in moderate to severe ID. Numerous researchers have found lower IQ scores in females with ASD (Banach et al., 2009; Lord, Schopler, & Revicki, 1982; Pilowsky, Yirmiya, Shulman, & Dover, 1998; Tsai & Beisler, 1983; Tsai, Stewart, & August, 1981; Volkmar, Szatmari, & Sparrow, 1993; Wing, 1981). Regarding male to female ratios, Wing (1981) found 1 girl compared to 16 boys with an autism diagnosis. In a separate group with the triad of language and social impairments, ratios were 9.5:1 in those with IQ above 50, compared to 2.2:1 for IQ between 20 and 49, and 0.9:1 for IQ between 0 and 19 (Wing, 1981). Tsai et al. (1981) found a ratio of 4.7:1 when IQ was greater than 70 compared to 2.9:1 when IQ was below 50. Lord et al. (1982) found a ratio of 5.2:1 (IQ > 80) versus 3.3:1 (IQ < 40). Tsai and Beisler (1983) found a ratio of 4.43:1 (IQ > 50) compared to 1.31:1 (IQ < 50). Significantly more females had IQ scores below 50 (Tsai & Beisler, 1983). Lord and Schopler (1985) found that females with ASD were more prevalent when IQ was less than 34. Volkmar et al. (1993) found higher sex ratios when IQ was greater than 70. Males with autism were 8.8 times (1.5 times for PDD-NOS) more likely to have an IQ over 70 (Volkmar et al., 1993). Findings of lower cognitive ability in females with ASD and greater male to female ratios in the absence of ID have continued to be replicated. In a study of 8-year olds with ASD in South Carolina, Nicholas et al. (2008) found that 72.7% of girls had an IQ below 70 compared to 56.4% of boys. The ratio was 4.9:1 (IQ
