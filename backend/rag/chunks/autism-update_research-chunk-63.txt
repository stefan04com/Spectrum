but were not invited to significantly more play dates • Parents reported that G1 spent less time engaged in minimally socially interactive activities during play dates compared with G2 (p<0.001), but did not spend significantly more time in socially interactive activities (such as talking) • Parents of G1 reported increased self-control in children (p<0.05) when provoked by others. No changes reported by teachers • G1 showed significant decreases in loneliness (p<0.025) and increases in popularity (p<0.025) following treatment relative to G2 • At long-term followup of G1, children with ASD demonstrated increased social opportunities for invited play dates and maintained at least one close friendship • Child report of loneliness also decreased in the long-term followup • Overall ratings of social skills continue to demonstrate gains along with reduction of problems behaviors over time Ichikawa et al. 2013 135 Japan G1: TEACCH, 5/5 G2: Wait list control, 6/6 Quality: Poor G1: 64 months G2: 62 months DQ (Kyoto Scale of Psychological Development): G1: 87 G2: 88 • Pilot study of Japanese participants with high functioning ASD and their mothers • G1 showed moderate improvement with regard to the children’s adaptive behaviors, social reciprocity, parenting stress, and parent–child interactions Peer Approaches Koenig et al. 2010 124 US G1: Peer tutor social skills training, 25/23 G2: Wait list control, 19/18 Quality: Good G1: 9.2±1.2 G2: 9.3±1.2 G1: 96.4±20.5 G2: 95.9±17.3 • Study included high functioning children with ASD (IQ≥70) • 16/23 G1 participants and 0/18 G2 were considered treatment responders (much improved or very much improved on CGI-I), p=.001 • Children with Asperger syndrome more likely to be responders vs. children with PDD-NOS, p=.03; no differences between those with autism and Asperger syndrome or PDD-NOS • IQ not associated with response status • No significant differences at followup within groups or between groups on social competence measures 46 Table 8. Summary of outcomes of social skills studies (continued) Author, Year, Country Groups, N Enrollment/N Final Study Quality Age, Mean Years±SD IQ, Mean±SD Key Outcomes Peer Approaches Kasari et al. 2012 125 US G1: Individualized child- directed social skills training (CHILD), 15/14 G2: Peer-mediated social skills training (PEER), 15/15 G3: CHILD+PEER, 15/15 G4: Control, 15/15 Quality: Fair G1: 8.23±1.48 G2: 7.60±1.35 G3: 8.67±1.68 G4: 8.07±1.69 G1: 93.93±19.60 G2: 84.80±10.12 G3: 90.33±14.17 G4: 95.07±19.44 • Study included high functioning children with ASD attending regular education classrooms for ≥80% of day, overall mean IQ=90.97±16.33; significantly more females in G2 compared with other groups, p=.004 • Social network salience increased for G2 and G3 compared with other groups, effect sizes for G2 ranged from 1.12 to 1.18 vs. G1 and G4 (p≤.006) at end of intervention; at followup 12 weeks post-intervention, salience significantly higher for G3 compared with G1 and G4 but not G2 • Solitary engagement on playground and joint attention improved at final followup for G2 • Teacher ratings of social skills improved from baseline for G2 (p=.01) but not G1, G3, or G4. No significant differences for any group at final followup Castorina
