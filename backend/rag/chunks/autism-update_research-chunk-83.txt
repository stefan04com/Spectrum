smoothly, and avoiding “getting stuck” (p values<.05) • Higher baseline scores predicted greater improvements in flexible thinking, social tasks, parent- and teacher-rated executive function shift and planning/organization measure, parent-rated Social Responsiveness Scale total score (p values <.05) • Higher IQ predicted greater improvements in flexible thinking, challenge task plan measure; younger age at baseline predicted greater improvement on challenge task plan measure and parent-rated executive function measures of shift and planning/organization (p values <.05) • Female sex predicted greater improvement on parent-rated Social Responsiveness Scale total score (p values <.05) Scarpa et al. 2011 175 US G1: CBT, 5/5 G2: Delayed treatment control, 6/6 Quality: Fair G1+G2 (range): 5-7 years IQ: NR • Pilot study to assess utility of CBT approach to improve emotion regulation (Sofronoff, 2005, 2007) in younger children • G1 articulated significantly greater number strategies in response to vignettes than G2 (mean 4 vs. 1.29, p<.05, effect size=0.65) • Greater parental confidence in own ability to manage child’s anger and greater confidence in child’s ability to manage anger and anxiety in G1 vs. G2 (p<.05, effect sizes=0.84 tob0.89) 65 Table 10. Summary of outcomes of studies of interventions targeting conditions commonly associated with ASD (continued) Author, Year, Country Groups, N Enrollment/N Final Study Quality Age, Mean Years±SD IQ, Mean±SD Key Outcomes Parent Training Studies RUPP 2012 167 , 179 - 181 , 184 G1: Risperidone, 49/36 (1-yr followup) G2: Risperidone+parent training, 75/51 (1-yr followup) Quality: Fair G1: 7.5±2.80 G2: 7.38±2.21 IQ>70, n (%) G1: 23 (46.9) G2: 46 (63) IQ<70, n(%) G1 : 26 (53.1) G2: 27 (37) • After 24 weeks of treatment, significant group by time interaction on the Home Situations Questionnaire (HSQ) (p<0.006); HSQ scores declined (i.e., decreased severity) in more children in G2; Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) irritability, stereotypic behaviors, hyperactivity subscales all showed significant group differences over time with less severe symptoms in each of the domains in G2 • After 24 weeks, Vineland socialization and adaptive composite standard scores and socialization, noncompliance, and communication age equivalent scores were significantly better in G2 vs. G1 (p≤.05, effect sizes ranging from 0.14 to 0.35); treatment gains were not associated with IQ or adaptive or maladaptive behaviors • Higher baseline HSQ scores predicted greater improvement regardless of treatment (p=.007); effect size of 0.81 (p<.01) for those with greater severity • Of 21 potential moderator variables (e.g., child age, maternal education) none significantly moderated HSQ or ABC-Hyperactivity scores, suggesting that parent training may be effective for a range of children • At followup of 87 participants 12-months post- intervention, between group differences on the HSQ or ABC were no longer significant • No between group differences in child inappropriate behavior in direct observations under various conditions (free play, restrictive, etc.); in analyses combining G1 and G2, child inappropriate behavior decreased from baseline in the demand and tangible restrictive conditions (p values<.01); increase in compliance in the demand condition (p=.0004) ABC = Aberrant Behavior Checklist; ASD = autism spectrum disorder; CBT = cognitive behavioral therapy; CGI
