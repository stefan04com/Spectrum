a variety of individual children and to adapt and alter treatments as needed is an understanding of the underlying theory and principles of the strategies one is employing. This is just the kind of information the reader of this book is getting. First, the authors pro- vide historical perspectives of the treatment described. This is important for giving readers (practitioners, researchers, families, students) the crucial context of the development of the field. Then the authors carefully and clearly present the theoreti- cal bases of the strategies themselves. Then there is the presentation of the specific strategies. These are not only explained in the text, but there are many very helpful charts and tables to further present the material. Overall this is a delightful book that is useful and practical and includes the con- text and rationale to enrich readers’ understanding of important concepts regarding the teaching of social and play skills. We are no longer teaching simple skills and repertoires as we did all those years. How far we have come!
