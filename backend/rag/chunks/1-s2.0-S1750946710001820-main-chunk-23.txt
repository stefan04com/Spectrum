(2003) found no significant gender differences in the model. Similarly, Mazefsky, Goin-Kochel, Riley, and Maes (2008) did not find model differences by gender in an ASD only sample using the ADI-R. In contrast, in a primarily general population sample, Ronald et al. (2006) found gender differences in the model using the CAST. Using multiple measures of social, behavioral, and cognitive measures as well as the CAST in the general population, Loat and colleagues (Loat, Asbury, Galsworthy, Plomin, & Craig, 2004; Loat et al., 2008) found higher heritability estimates in males, but hypothesized this was more indicative of X-linked quantitative trait loci. In summary, results have been inconsistent in the few studies which have been conducted, and these studies have varied widely in methodology, namely the population and instruments employed. Finally, as mentioned previously, Nishiyama et al. (2009) did not find significant gender differences in genetic and environmental factors in the relationship between autistic traits and IQ. Several researchers have found differential results of linkage studies based on gender. Sex-specific linkages have been found on chromosomes 17 (Cantor et al., 2005; Duvall et al., 2007; Stone et al., 2004; Strom et al., 2009), 7 (Lamb et al., 2005; Schellenberg et al., 2006), 11 (Autism Risk Genome Project Consortium et al., 2007; Duvall et al., 2007; Schellenberg et al., 2006), and 15 (Autism Risk Genome Project Consortium et al., 2007; Lamb et al., 2005), as well as on chromosome 16 (Lamb et al., 2005), 4, 8, and 10 (Duvall et al., 2007), and 5 and 9 (Autism Risk Genome Project Consortium et al., 2007). In addition, Lamb et al. (2005) found parent of origin effects on chromosomes 7 and 9. Therefore, stratifying genetic linkage analyses based on gender and whether genes were inherited from the mother or father has yielded differential results on a number of chromosomes. 5. Etiology of gender differences in ASD A wide range of hypotheses on the etiology of gender differences in ASD have been proposed, implicating a number of different mechanisms. Given the evidence for high heritability of ASD, the large majority of researchers turned to genetic hypotheses to account for the significant gender differences, and this is evident even in the initial early hypotheses put forth. This focus on genetics is consistent with the ASD literature base in general (Matson & LoVullo, 2009). Miles and Hillman T.T. Rivet, J.L. Matson / Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders 5 (2011) 957–976 966 (2000, p. 251) declared ‘‘It is commonly acknowledged that in order to understand the genetic basis of autism, we will have to understand the male predominance.’’ Other hypotheses have implicated gender differences in typically developing populations, brain lateralization, and hormonal influences. Finally, while most have focused on biological etiologies, some have noted environmental factors such as diagnostic issues and gender biases. 5.1. Multifactorial liability/threshold model Tsai and colleagues (Tsai & Beisler, 1983; Tsai et al., 1981) applied the multifactorial genetic transmission hypothesis to account for gender differences in ASD. According to Tsai and colleagues, in this
