of leisure skills. For example, for the child who wants to spend most of his free time with his object of obsession, Batman, it will be important to teach him various ways to do so instead of just watching a video. In addition to drawing Batman, there may be Batman cards that the child can use to play a version of “Solitaire” involving matching up the numbers on the cards. Or, they can look at Batman comic books. Even if they are not actually reading the comic books, they may enjoy looking at the pictures. There also may be a Batman pencil that the child can use to do homework. Perhaps the child would be more likely to shoot baskets or bounce a ball if it was a Batman ball. These are all ways to initially use Batman to teach new leisure skills. Then, we would want to promote generalization to other stimuli so we may want to have the child use other stimuli (another superhero or just a plain ball, etc.). Conclusion Basic modeling and prompting procedures are generally used to teach functional, cooperative, and independent play. These procedures are used to teach the more basic building blocks or foundation of play. Instructions for teaching more sophisti- cated forms of play such as pretend play or sociodramatic play procedures are dis- cussed in later chapters such as Chap. 5 on Video Modeling and Chap. 6 on Visual Strategies.
