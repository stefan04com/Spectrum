SD Intervention Provider Intervention Setting Intervention Manualized? Intervention Intensity, Duration, And Focus Key Outcomes score on receptive language measure vs. G2 (p=.048) • In analyses of G1 participants in privately purchased vs. publicly funded EIBI programs, IQ declined for the publicly funded group compared with the control or privately purchased participants (p<.0001); privately purchased participants maintained IQ and adaptive behavior gains from end of intervention to the 2 year followup. Publicly funded group had more severe ASD symptoms, lower adaptive behavior, and received less intensive intervention than the privately purchased group Parent Training Schreibman et al. 2013 17 US G1: Pivotal Response Training (PRT), 20/20 G2: PECS, 19/19 Quality: Good G1: 29.5 ± 6.9 G2: 28.9 ± 4.2 NR G1+G2: Trained therapists, parents G1+G2: Home G1: Yes G2: Yes G1+G2: Mean 247 hrs treatment over 23 weeks, G1 focused on motivational techniques delivered by parents to facilitate communication. G2 focused on motivational techniques to facilitate augmented communication • Children in both G1 and G2 showed gains in language from baseline to followup 3 months after the end of treatment but no between group differences reported; effect sizes for change ranged from .001 to .486 • In the PECS group 12/19 children mastered requesting and were learning to comment using pictures • Mean number of spoken words gained across groups=80; individual progress varied widely , with 78% of children using at least 10 spoken words at final followup Strauss et al, 2012 18 , 19 Italy G1 : Staff and parent mediated EIBI, 24/24 G1 : 55.67 ± 17.63 G2 : 41.94 ± 13.07 GMDS-ER GQ G1 : 55.65 ± 20.06 G1 + G2 : Staff and parents G2 : Parents G1 : G1 : No G2 : No G1: For 12 months, alternated between one week of 25 hours of therapist-led center- based intervention and 3 • Compared to G2, children in G1 showed significant decrease in autism symptom severity, increases in language production and mental development • Compared to G1, children in G2 had F-10 Author, Year, Country Groups, N Enrollment/N Final Study Quality Age, Mean Months ± SD IQ, Mean ± SD Intervention Provider Intervention Setting Intervention Manualized?

Focus on individual skills, problem behaviors, and facilitated play and social interaction G2 : In-home developmental intervention and cognitive behavioral treatment for approximately 12 hours/week. Focus determined by staff expertise and preferences. improved parent - reported socialization and motor skills • In G1, older children achieved better adaptive behavior outcomes; younger children made more gains in early language comprehension and production. Children who gained more language comprehension had higher adaptive behavior scores pre- treatment. Pre-treatment language comprehension predicted post-treatment language production • In G2, higher pre-treatment mental development state and early language skills predicted better outcome on adaptive behaviors. Initial higher adaptive behaviors predicted better
