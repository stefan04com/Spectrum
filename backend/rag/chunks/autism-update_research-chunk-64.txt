Age was correlated with identification of fear expressions, affect recognition. Verbal IQ was associated with some short term improvements Young et al. 2011 132 Australia G1: Emotion recognition training (Transporters DVD), 13/13 G2: Control (Thomas the Tank Engine DVD), 12/12 Quality: Fair G1+G2 (range): 4-8 years G1: 11.31 (4.17) G2: 8.67 (4.05) • Videos provided to groups differed in level of emphasis on emotion recognition • Affect recognition improved significantly in G1 vs. G2 (effect size=0.53, p<.001) as did Faces task scores (effect size=0.31, p=.005) • Both groups improved significantly on measures of social peer interest and eye contact; between group differences were not significant • Improvements in G1 were associated with extent of attention to faces in the DVD in G1 (r=0.59, p=.036) but not in G2; IQ was not correlated with improvements in either group 47 Table 8.
