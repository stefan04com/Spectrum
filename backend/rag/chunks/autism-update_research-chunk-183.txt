Children who gained more language comprehension had higher adaptive behavior scores pre-treatment. Pre-treatment language comprehension predicted post-treatment language production. Eclectic group: Higher pre-treatment mental C-116 G1: 24 G2: 20 N at follow-up: G1: NR G2: NR development state and early language skills predicted better outcome on adaptive behaviors. Initial higher adaptive behaviors predicted better post-treatment early language comprehension. In both groups, the predictive power of parental stress on outcome autism severity was modified by perception of difficult child, with higher perceptions of difficulty associated with lower decreases in autism severity. In both groups, child outcomes on early language skills, mental developmental state and adaptive behaviors are significantly influenced by parental stress, child ability to respond correctly to prompts, number and difficulty of treatment targets, and child problem behaviors in sessions.
