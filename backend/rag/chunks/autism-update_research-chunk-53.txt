behavior outcomes; younger children made more gains in early language comprehension and production. Children who gained more language comprehension had higher adaptive behavior scores pre-treatment. Pre-treatment language comprehension predicted post-treatment language production • In G2, higher pre-treatment mental development state and early language skills predicted better outcome on adaptive behaviors. Initial higher adaptive behaviors predicted better post-treatment early language comprehension • In both groups, child outcomes on early language skills, mental developmental state and adaptive behaviors were significantly influenced by parental stress, child ability to respond correctly to prompts, number and difficulty of treatment targets, and child problem behaviors in sessions. The predictive power of parental stress on outcome ASD severity was modified by perception of difficult child, with higher perceptions of difficulty associated with lower decreases in ASD severity Aldred et al. 2011 72 , 105 UK G1: Parent training in social communication intervention plus community intervention, 14/14 G2: Community intervention, 14/14 Quality: Good G1: 51.4±11.8 G2: 50.9±16.3 NR • G1 showed improvements in ADOS scores, social interaction, expressive language, child communication acts during interaction; no adaptive behavior differences or differences in parenting stress between groups • Language gains particularly prominent in younger, lower functioning children. • Increased parental synchrony (communication which maintained vs. redirected or controlled child responses) in G1 associated with reduction in child ADOS score (decreased impairment, p=.014); reduction in synchrony for G2 and small increase in mean ADOS scores. In tests of mediation, change in parental synchrony accounted for 34% of total treatment effect on ADOS outcome Roberts et al. 2011 96 Australia G1 : Individualized home- based program, 34/27 G2 : Small group center- based program combined with parent training and support group, 33/29 G3: Waitlist, 28/28 Quality: Good G1 : 41.5 G2 : 43.1 G3: 43.7 G1 : 57±11.7 G2 : 66±17.7 G3: 63.3±15.5 • Significant greater improvement in Reynell comprehension standard score for G2 compared with G1 (-7.3; 95% CI (-13.9, - 0.7), p=0.02); greater improvement for expression standard score of the Reynell for the G2 compared with G1 (-3.0; 95% CI (-9.0, 2.9), P=0.31) • Reynell standard comprehension and expression scores G3 performed better than G1, but not significantly • For the Reynell standard comprehension and expression scores G2 performed better than G3 but not significantly. • G3 improved significantly more than the G1 for the social scale of the Vineland • No statistically significant differences among the three groups for other child outcomes. When analyses were limited only to children with autism spectrum diagnoses, the magnitude of the effects increased but the presence or absence of statistical significance did not. • Parent outcomes: Parenting: statistically significant differences favoring G2 vs. G1 • No significant difference between groups for stress 36 Table 7.
