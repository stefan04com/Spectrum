a higher threshold because they have a second paternal X in which the locus is expressed. The model proposes that genetic vulnerability is primarily due to effects from autosomal loci, and ASD symptoms largely result from genetic or environmental influences independent of the sex chromosomes (Skuse, 1999, 2000; Skuse et al., 1997). Donnelly et al. (2000) presented an additional case of a female with autistic disorder, Turner’s syndrome, and a maternally inherited X-chromosome. Thomas et al. (1999) presented eight females (three with autistic disorder) with deletions on the short arm of the X. In contrast, in female probands, Pickles et al. (2000) did not find higher rates of the broader autism phenotype in paternal grandmothers or daughters of paternal uncles. In Turner’s syndrome, researchers have investigated Skuse’s hypothesis related to memory (Bishop et al., 2000), ADHD (Russell et al., 2006), physical/medical variables and academic achievement (Sagi et al., 2007), and mouse models (see Lynn & Davies, 2007). Evolutionary models have been proposed as to why imprinting may have evolved. Shaner, Miller, and Mintz (2008) proposed that imprinting serves to alter the fitness sensitivity of a parent-selected fitness indicator (i.e., early social/ communicative behaviors), due to resource allocation needed for sons by mothers. Badcock and Crespi (Badcock & Crespi, 2006; Badcock & Crespi, 2008; Crespi & Badcock, 2008) hypothesized an evolutionary struggle between parents based on cost/benefit during early and later development; and that ASD (i.e., mechanistic, male brain) is the diametric opposite of psychotic spectrum conditions (schizophrenia, bipolar, major depression; mentalistic, female brain), which are of more paternal versus maternal benefit, respectively. Debate has ensued surrounding this theory (see commentaries and replies in Crespi & Badcock, 2008). T.T. Rivet, J.L. Matson / Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders 5 (2011) 957–976 969 5.6.2. X-inactivation/X-linkage hypothesis Loat et al. (2004) and Loat et al. (2008) proposed the presence of quantitative trait loci (QTL) on the X-chromosome for social, behavioral, and cognitive traits found in ASD. In addition, Loat et al. (2008) proposed that gender differences in ASD arose due to X-inactivation (see Craig et al., 2004; Skuse, 2006). In males, genes subject to random X-inactivation will be fully expressed because they have a single X (Skuse, 2006). However, some genes escape inactivation and some do not have a Y homologue, resulting in two active copies in females versus one in males (Craig et al., 2004). Males may lack a functional copy on the Y for X-linked genes that escaped inactivation (Skuse, 2006). Also, inactivation may be skewed either by chance or as a result of X mutations (Craig et al., 2004). Loat et al. (2004) and Loat et al. (2008) hypothesized that in monozygotic (MZ) twins, female twins would be less similar on these X-linked traits due to random X-inactivation. Conversely in dizygotic (DZ) twins, female twins would be more similar on these traits, due to the presence of an active paternal X in half of the cells, compared to males having either the mother’s maternal or paternal X (Loat et al.,
