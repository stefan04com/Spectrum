Parents G2: Preschool teachers G1: Home G2: Preschool G1: NR G2: NA G1: Parents received 4 two-hour training sessions plus 3 hour home visits every 6 weeks for 12 months focusing on promoting joint attention and language skills; children also received standard preschool care as noted below (mean 5.2 periods in preschool/day, mean 70.9 ± 131.2 minutes of therapies in preschool/week) G2: Specialized daycare or medical nursery for children with developmental issues; both provide individualized speech, motor, music, and play therapy with variable levels of parental support (mean 4.2 periods in preschool/day, mean 76.4 ± 112.8 minutes of therapies in preschool/week) • No between group differences on language development after 12 months of intervention, though language skills within groups improved over time • No differences in CGI-Improvement scores (G1: 57% much improved, G2: 52% much improved) • No significant effects on parenting skills in either group; engagement, early social communication precursors, parental skills not found to be mediators of effects.

No differences were found in the amount of improvement between G2-G4 F-18 Author, Year, Country Groups, N Enrollment/N Final Study Quality Age, Mean Months ± SD IQ, Mean ± SD Intervention Provider Intervention Setting Intervention Manualized?
