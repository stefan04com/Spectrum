following the child’s communicative gesture (reaching for bottle while looking at parent) can increase the child’s likelihood of trying to communicate in the future. The parent’s modeling of the verbal request (“bottle please”) helps teach the child how to make that request verbally. This type of responsivity to a child’s early-in-life vocaliza- tions and gestures supports social skill acquisition and language development (Hancock et al., 2016). Summary Points • Like motor skill development, play and social development in typical childhood has a predictable trajectory wherein skills are acquired in approximately the same sequence and at roughly the same time of life across children. • The acquisition of early social and play skills can lead to opportunities for chil- dren to learn even more skills. • Many foundational skills essential for healthy development across many domains of functioning can be acquired in the context of play and social interaction. • Unfortunately, the social and play deficits associated with ASD may interrupt or impede this developmental process. • Even though ASD may be caused by one or more biological (nature) factors, intervention involving changes to how people interact with the child and other aspects of the child’s environment can remediate those skill deficits. • All children can learn. • Parents and caregivers can support play and social development by talking to and around children, playing with children, and being responsive to children’s early social and play behaviors.
