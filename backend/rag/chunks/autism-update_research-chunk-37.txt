Effects of Behavioral Interventions on Core and Commonly Associated Symptoms in Children With ASD A wide range of interventions can be classified as behavioral. For the 2011 review and this update, we included studies of early intensive behavioral and developmental interventions, which comprised University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)/Lovaas-based approaches, the Early Start Denver Model (ESDM), and parent training approaches incorporating principles of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) to improve outcomes among young children with ASD; social skills interventions; focal play-based /interaction-based interventions; behavioral interventions focused on commonly associated behaviors; and a small group of other behavioral interventions assessing other interventions in core/associated areas (e.g., sleep workshops). Early Intensive Behavioral and Developmental Interventions Key Points • Of the 25 new studies addressing early intensive behavioral and developmental interventions, eight were good, 13 were fair, and four were poor quality. • Many studies used parent-report measures of adaptive and ASD symptom-related outcomes, which may be confounded by parental stress, parental involvement in treatment protocols, and nonrandom assignment based upon parental treatment preferences. • All studies of ABA-based interventions compared a minimum of two treatment groups. No study included a control group that was not receiving some type of intervention (including school enrollment or eclectic community-based therapies, such as medication or occupational therapy), although some limited the number of behaviorally based treatment hours that control participants could receive. • Studies with parent training components reported improvements in language with inconsistent results for other outcomes. • No studies reported harms related to children. Overview of the Literature In the 2011 review, we identified 17 comparative studies 57-75 (described in 19 papers), of which six were RCTs (two good quality, 73 , 75 four fair 57 , 69 , 71 , 72 ), five were nonrandomized trials (four fair quality, 64-68 , 74 one poor 70 ), four were prospective cohort studies (three fair
