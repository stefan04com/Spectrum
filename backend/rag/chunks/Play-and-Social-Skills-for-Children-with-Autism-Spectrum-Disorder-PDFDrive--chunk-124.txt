Once you have selected the outcome(s) targeted for intervention and the peers to be involved in the intervention, it is time to plan for and design the peer training procedures. This involves deciding what will be taught dur- ing the training, selecting instructional strategies, and determining when peers will be trained, by whom, and in what setting. In some cases, beginning the training with an overview of ASD may be helpful for teaching peers what to expect when they interact with the focus child. For younger children, it may be helpful to be specific to the focus child, rather than talking in broad or abstract terms. The interventionist may conduct a discussion session during which peers consider their own strengths and areas of growth, as well as strengths and areas of growth for the focus child. For example, the interventionist can say, “Sean loves playing with Legos™. He can build really tall towers!” The interventionist can then ask the peers to brainstorm their own areas of strength, “What are some things that you do well?” Then the interventionist can focus the discussion on areas for growth, “Sean sometimes needs help talking to his friends, especially asking his friends to play with him. What are some things that you need help doing?” In this way, the interventionist is focused on developing empathy between the peers and the focus child, rather than taking an approach that solely focuses on the differences or deficits of the focus child. Following this overview, the interventionist can help prepare the peers for what they should do or say to help the focus child. Research shows peers can be effec- tively trained using a combination of verbal instruction, discussion, modeling, and role play. Verbal instruction should include a clear statement of the rationale for the intervention and why the peer intervention is important. The interventionist may provide direct instruction and tell the peers exactly what to do. For example, “You can help Sean learn how to talk to his friends by asking Sean to play Legos™ with you during center time. You can say, ‘Let’s play Legos™, Sean!’” Alternatively, the interventionist may incorporate a discussion-based approach. In this approach, the interventionist can ask peers to brainstorm ways to initiate social interaction or play with the focus child, topics to discuss with the focus child, or activities or toys to engage in with the focus child. Following verbal instruction or discussion, it is critical to show the peers the behaviors they will engage in as part of PMI by modeling the behaviors. The inter- ventionist can model the behaviors, ask peers to model the behaviors, or show video examples of children engaged in the target behaviors. Peers should also be given
