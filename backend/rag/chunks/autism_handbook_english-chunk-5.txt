Families of children age five and younger with a diagnosis of ASD may receive up to $22,000 per year towards eligible interventions. Your child’s intervention program must be based on a plan that takes into account his or her unique strengths and needs. This Behaviour Plan of Intervention (BPI) is written by a behaviour consultant/analyst, with input from family members and other professional team members, such as the speech-language pathologist, occupational therapist and/or physical therapist. The BPI should be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure that your child is making meaningful progress. For more information on BPIs, see page 25. For children under the age of 6, the professionals (Behaviour Consultant/Analyst; Speech-Language Pathologist; Occupational Therapist; Physiotherapist) that you choose to develop and monitor your child’s plan of intervention must be selected from the Registry
