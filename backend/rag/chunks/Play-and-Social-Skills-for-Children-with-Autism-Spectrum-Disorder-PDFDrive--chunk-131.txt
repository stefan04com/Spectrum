As parents coo and smile at their infant, the infant is exposed to the reciprocal nature of social interaction. As parents point to something flying above them and say “Bird!” the toddler learns to associate the word “bird” with the flying creature. Indeed, young children’s social- emotional and language development are greatly influenced through these daily interactions with their parents (Hart & Risley, 1995). Typically developing children and their parents may be able to create these learning opportunities with ease and require little, if any, external assistance. Yet, children with ASD often require explicit instruction to develop social interaction and communication skills. Such intentional and explicit instruction may not already be within parents’ skill sets. Parent-implemented intervention refers to at least one primary caregiver being taught by a professional to serve as an interventionist for their child (Beaudoin, Sébire, & Couture, 2014; Hong, Ganz, Neely, Gerow, & Ninci, 2016). Parent- implemented intervention is based on the theory that changing parent behavior can lead to changes in child behavior (Kashinath, Woods, & Goldstein, 2006). Parent- implemented intervention is cost-effective (Wainer & Ingersoll, 2015) and usually non-intensive instruction
