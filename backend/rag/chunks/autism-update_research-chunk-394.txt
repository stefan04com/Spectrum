G1 improved on parent - rated reciprocal social interaction (p<.05) • No significant differences among groups on any measure at followup • Children with higher Mullen scores made fewer gains in G1; children with high Preschool Language Scale scores at baseline had higher communication and F-8 Author, Year, Country Groups, N Enrollment/N Final Study Quality Age, Mean Months ± SD IQ, Mean ± SD Intervention Provider Intervention Setting Intervention Manualized?
