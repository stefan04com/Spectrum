> 70) compared to 2.4:1 (IQ < 70). Finally, the proportion of males to females with ASD was similar when IQ was below 34 (Nicholas et al., 2008). Bhasin and Schendel (2007) found a higher sex ratio in children with ASD and an IQ above 70 (4.6:1) compared to those with ASD and an IQ below 70 (3.5:1). In simplex (single incidence) families, Banach et al. (2009) found that 54.8% of females compared to 20.3% of males had an IQ below 50. The sex ratios were similar when IQ was below 50, compared to 8.3:1 when IQ was above 70 (Banach et al., 2009). In contrast in multiplex families, where more than one child has ASD, gender differences in IQ have not been found (Banach et al., 2009; Spiker et al., 2001). In contrast to the previously mentioned studies which used an ASD population, Bryson et al. (2008) used an epidemiological study of ID in Ontario to examine the prevalence of autism in adolescents with mild (IQ = 50–75) or severe (IQ < 50) ID. Consistent with previous research, the overall sex ratio for autism was 2.3:1, with higher ratios in mild ID (2.8:1) compared to severe ID (2:1; Bryson et al., 2008). In further analyzing the frequency data, regardless of ID, overall, males were more likely to have autism. Regardless of autism, females were more likely to have severe ID versus mild ID. However, males with severe ID were significantly more likely to have autism than males with mild ID or females. The authors highlighted the increased risk of autism in males with severe ID (Bryson et al., 2008). In conclusion, findings related to ID are one of the earliest and most consistent findings in this literature (Matson, Mahan, Hess & Fodstad, 2010; Njardvik, Matson & Cherry, 1999). Females with ASD have lower average intellectual ability than males, and the male to female sex ratio in ASD is highest when ID is not present. Given the evidence for significant gender differences in ASD associated with ID, it follows that factors related to ID must be considered in evaluating the research that has been conducted in this area. 4.1.2. Relationships between gender differences, IQ, and ASD Researchers have pointed out methodological issues associated with IQ (Matson & Shoemaker, 2009). The relationships between gender differences, IQ, and autism symptoms have not yet been determined (Lord & Schopler, 1985; Volkmar et al., 1993). Previous research has not distinguished between severity of autism and severity of ID (Lord & Schopler, 1985; Volkmar et al., 1993). Furthermore, Volkmar et al. (1993) noted that the appropriateness of controlling for IQ depends on whether low IQ is a cause or consequence of gender differences in ASD. If low IQ is a separate associated feature, controlling for it may result in overmatching (i.e., controlling for factors that are not confounding variables) and inhibit understanding of true differences (Volkmar et al., 1993). Research and hypotheses have since been put forth concerning these issues. Nishiyama et al. (2009) evaluated
