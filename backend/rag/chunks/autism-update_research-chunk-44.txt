outcomes (p=.004) and overall adaptive behavior (p=.036), Vineland communication (p=.034) and socialization (p=.008) for G1 vs. G2; no significant differences in Vineland daily living skills between groups • Effect size for change in IQ=1.03 (95% CI: .34 to 1.72) and for change in overall adaptive behavior=.73 (95% CI: .05 to 1.36) • Baseline age and PDD-NOS or Asperger diagnosis correlated with larger gains in overall adaptive behavior, communication, and daily living skills; baseline IQ positively correlated with Vineland socialization gains Eikeseth et al. 2012 78 Norway/Sweden G1: Early intensive intervention, 35 / 13- 15 depending on outcome G2: Standard care , 24 / NR Quality: Fair G1: 3.9±0.9 years G2: 4.4±1.2 years Vineland age equivalent: G1: 1.9±0.9 G2: 2.1±0.8 • G1 scored significantly higher on all Vineland scales as compared withG2 (p<0.05) with an effect size of Total (composite)=0.92, Communication=1.08, ADL=0.71, Socialization=0.75,Motor=0.70, and Learning rate=0.97 • G1: CARS scores continued to decrease significantly during the second year of treatment (from 31.8 (SD=8.5) to 27.2 (SD=6.2), p<.05), effect size of 0.59 • Children receiving G1 scored significantly higher on standard scores of adaptive behavior. • Significant improvements were found in maladaptive behaviors and excess and deficit behaviors as compared with G2 • Largest gains were observed during the first year. Effect size on all measures at year one were moderate to large Flanagan et al. 2012 86-88 , 90 , 110 Canada G1: Intensive behavioral intervention, 61/61 G2: Wait list control (matched by age), 61/61 Quality: Fair G1: 42.93±11.53 G2: 42.79±10.51 NR • In 2008 retrospective case series (Perry 2008) reporting on ~30% of G1 participants ASD severity (CARS), cognitive level, adaptive behavior, and rate of development improved significantly (all p <.001); outcomes varied across children: approximately 25% showed substantial improvements, 30% showed clinically significant improvement, 19% showed some/modest improvement, 25% showed no improvement or worsening of outcome. Analyses of a subset of the total participants (n=89) showed similar improvements (Freeman 2010) • Age (younger at baseline), IQ, adaptive behavior, and ASD severity were correlated with outcome; IQ was strongest predictor, accounting for 5- 12% of the variance in outcomes (Perry 2011); in sub-set analysis (Shine 2010), duration of intervention also associated with better outcomes • ASD severity improved for G1 vs. G2 as did Vineland composite 26 Table 6. Key outcomes of ABA - based early intervention studies ( continued ) Author, Year, Country Groups, N Enrollment/N Final Study Quality Age, Mean Months±SD IQ, Mean±SD • Key Outcomes standard and ratio scores and IQ estimates (p values≤.033, effect sizes ranging from 0.53 to 0.83); 19 point difference in IQ at end of intervention in favor of G1 • Younger age at intervention and higher adaptive skills associated with better outcomes; adaptive skills also associated with better outcomes for G2. Duration of intervention became nonsignificant after intervention type was entered into statistical models (Flanagan 2012) • In retrospective analyses (Perry 2013), higher baseline IQ predicted gains in IQ, and children starting early intervention at younger ages (2-5 years) gained significantly more
