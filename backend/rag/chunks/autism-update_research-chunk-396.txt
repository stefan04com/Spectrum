post-treatment early language comprehension. • In both groups, child outcomes on early language skills, mental developmental state and adaptive behaviors were significantly influenced by parental stress, child ability to respond correctly to prompts, number and difficulty of treatment targets, and child problem behaviors in sessions. The predictive power of parental stress on outcome autism severity was modified by perception of difficult child, with higher perceptions of difficulty associated with lower decreases in autism severity • Less parent inclusion in treatment provision resulted in decreased perceptions of a difficult child and less parental stress Landa et al. 2012 20 , 21 G1: 28.6 ± 2.6 G1: Trained G1: Yes G1: Mean 205.66 ± • Greater socially engaged imitation in G1 F-11 Author, Year, Country Groups, N Enrollment/N Final Study Quality Age, Mean Months ± SD IQ, Mean ± SD Intervention Provider Intervention Setting Intervention Manualized?
