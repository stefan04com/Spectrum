and communication, the reduction of depressive symptoms (Yoo et al., 2014), in some cases; an improvement in emotional regulation and behavioral adaptation in both school and family contexts (Beaumont et al., 2015); as well as an increase in play and socialization (MacCormack et al., 2015; Mandelberg et al., 2015). There is even talk of an improvement in parasympathetic cardiac control, which has been correlated with social behavior (Neuhaus et al., 2014). The importance of the involvement of parents (Haven et al., 2014) and teachers (Dekker et al. (2014) in intervention programs is also highlighted in some of the conclusions of the reviewed works. However, sometimes the different programs included in the reviewed articles lead to different conclusions. This may be due to multiple reasons such as, for example, the symptomatic diversity of children with ASD, as well as their different characteristics, the sample chosen, the intervention process, the previous interventions carried out, the training of the professionals who carry out the intervention, the duration of the sessions and how they are spaced, the organization of the process, the measurement of the results, etc. Also, it should always be borne in mind that each child with ASD is totally different from the rest, so an intervention that works for one may not be suitable for another. Therefore, we insist on special attention to each case and the achievement of the needs that each situation requires, whenever possible, adapting the programs to the characteristics of the child with ASD, TABLE 1 ALL OF THE STUDIES INCLUDE AN ASD GROUP IN THEIR SAMPLE AND SOME STUDIES INCLUDE PARENTS OR PEER GROUPS (Continuation) AQ: Autism Spectrum Quotient ARSFM: Augmented Reality-Based Self-Facial Modeling ASDS: Asperger Syndrome Diagnostic Scale ASSP: Autism Social Skills Profile ASSQ: Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire ATEC: Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist BASC-2: Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition BASC-2-TRS: The Behavioral Assessment System for Children – Preschool and Elementary Version 2, Teacher BCS.
