Autism Spectrum Disorder in 2023 Turk Arch Pediatr 2023, [epub ahead of print] into the 5 diagnostic categories established by the DSM-IV (autistic disorder, Rett’s disorder, childhood disintegrative dis- order, Asperger’s disorder, and pervasive developmental dis- order not otherwise specified), 2 unifying everything under the term ASD, 1 has not been without criticism, and it is hoped that it will be corrected in the next edition of the DSM. 3 Despite vari- ous attempts to find a biological marker, today, the diagnosis of ASD is still based solely on clinical criteria. 1 From a historical perspective, the first reports of children with autism have been till today attributed by most authors to Leo Kanner (1943) 4 and Hans Asperger (1944), 5 but in reality, the first to describe this condition in a scientific journal was a woman, Grunya Efimovna Sukhareva, who in 1926 reported 6 boys with autism (which today would be defined “high func- tioning”), providing a lot of clinical details, including sensory abnormalities, 6,7 which acquired their proper weight only in the DSM-5’s description of ASD. 1 As concerns ASD etiopathogenesis, while in the past the psy- chogenetic theories prevailed, today we know that ASD is a condition with a neurobiological basis. The etiology is multifac- torial and is characterized by an interaction between genetic and environmental factors. 8 In this narrative review, we aim to provide an update about this condition, considering epidemiology, etiopathogenesis, clinical presentation, instrumental investigations, early signs and onset patterns, neuropsychological hypotheses, treatments, and long-term outcome. EPIDEMIOLOGY AND ETIOPATHOGENESIS OF AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER According to the most recent epidemiological studies car- ried out in the United States, ASD recurs in 1 in 36 children at age 8, and it is about 4 times more frequent among males than females. 9 The prevalence of this condition has increased enormously over the last few decades; This increase would be to some extent apparent as there is now greater awareness of this condition, but it would be largely real. 10 This last aspect prompted a search for possible environmental factors whose effects would add up to a genetic predisposition leading to the development of autism. 8 Indeed, early exposure, in particular during pregnancy and in the first year of extrauterine life, to air pollutants (especially particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 μ m) 11 or to agricultural pesticides 12 is associated with a higher risk for ASD. But the genetic and environmental variables involved are extremely numerous, and conclusive data regarding the etio- pathogenesis of ASD are still far away. Assuming that a well- defined etiology is still found today only in a minority of cases with ASD, numerous pathogenetic mechanisms have been hypothesized and supported by interesting data.
