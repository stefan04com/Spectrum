Teaching Play and Social Skills to Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder Through Video Modeling Background Rationale for Video Modeling The rationale for video modeling dates all the way back to Albert Bandura’s early work on social learning theory: observational learning (Bandura, 1991; Bandura & Huston, 1961). The premise is relatively simple for neurotypical children; with observational learning, children learn behaviors by observing others (Gaskins & Paradise, 2010). A child can learn a new behavior by watching another engage in it and increase the occurrence or performance of a behavior already in his/her behav- ioral repertoire. For neurotypical children, observational learning comes naturally to them, and it has been shown that they can learn through observation as early as 21 days old. How do we know that observational learning has taken place? The child observes and subsequently imitates the behavior. In their seminal article on observational learning, Bandura and Huston (1961) showed that modeled play behaviors observed by 3–5-year-old preschool children affected their subsequent behavior. Children, who viewed a model playing aggres- sively with a punching “Bobo” doll, demonstrated significantly more aggressive play than the children who observed someone playing without aggression. Additional research has found that neurotypical children can learn a range of skills through observational learning (Bandura, 1977), including motor behaviors (Kampiotis & Theodorakou, 2007), facial expressions (Meltzoff & Moore, 1977), and moral judg- ments (Brody & Henderson, 1977). In fact, neurotypical children engage in obser- vational learning throughout their daily routines, and this is a core mechanism that facilitates child development (Fenstermacher & Saudino, 2006). However, children with ASD do not learn in
