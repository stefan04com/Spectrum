of genetic predisposition, but a factor relating to genetic or hormonal sex differences enables them to compensate for that risk. They are, therefore, less likely to manifest the full range of autistic symptoms, as conventionally measured’’ (Skuse, 2007, p. 393). In summary, there is a multitude of evidence to suggest overlap in genetic factors related to ASD and IQ; however, Nishiyama et al. (2009) did not identify gender differences in this relationship. Further research is needed as symptom areas in ASD (e.g., social, communication, behavior) may be differentially associated with IQ. Autistic traits frequently present in ID and have been found to be associated with IQ. Conversely, in the general population, autistic traits have been found to be continually distributed and not related to IQ. Skuse (2007) purported that ASD and ID do not have common causes. Rather, females may be similar in genetic predisposition to ASD, but more able to compensate for that risk than males. Thus, the causal relationships between ID, ASD, and gender differences remain unclear and complicate investigation of the nature and etiology of gender differences in ASD. 4.2. ASD symptoms Despite the long recognized predominance of males with ASD, few researchers have examined gender differences in ASD symptoms (Matson & LoVullo, 2009). There is a dearth of research (fewer than 10 studies) on gender differences in ASD symptoms in an ASD population. Regarding IQ, methodology has differed, with researchers either not controlling for IQ (Hus, Pickles, Cook, Risi, & Lord, 2007; Nicholas et al., 2008; Tsai & Beisler, 1983; Tsai et al., 1981), limiting inclusion to participants within the average IQ range (Holtmann, Bo ¨ lte, & Poustka, 2007; McLennan et al., 1993), using IQ as a covariate or matching participants based on IQ (Carter et al., 2007; Pilowsky et al., 1998), or conducting the analyses both with and without IQ as a covariate (Banach et al., 2009; Lord et al., 1982; Volkmar et al., 1993). Regarding age, the large majority of the research involved children, with one researcher focusing on toddlers (Carter et al., 2007) and three researchers including adult participants, up to mid-thirties (McLennan et al., 1993; Pilowsky et al., 1998) or early-fifties (Hus et al., 2007) in age. Researchers have also examined gender differences in ASD symptoms in the general population, sometimes including a subgroup of participants with ASD (Allison et al., 2008; Ronald et al., 2006; Williams et al., 2008), with one study focusing on an adults (Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, Skinner, Martin, & Clubley, 2001) and one on toddlers (Allison et al., 2008). Following is a review of the literature on gender differences in ASD based on the core symptom areas, as well as the literature in the general population on gender differences in ASD symptoms. 4.2.1. Socialization Lord et al. (1982) found lower Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS; Sparrow, Balla, & Cicchetti, 1984) Social Quotients in females ages 3–8 years with ASD, though this difference disappeared when IQ was included as a covariate. No significant differences were found on Psychoeducational Profile
