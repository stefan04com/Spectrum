behavior of another person, the observer engages in the same behavior that was observed, for example, a child goes down a slide after watching another child use the slide Imitation is fundamental to the acquisition of speech and is a primary mechanism for learning a variety of skills across domains (Heimann, Nordqvist, Strid, Almrot, & Tjus, 2016) Joint attention Coordinated attention between two people wherein a person looks at another person’s eyes and then follows their eye gaze to observe the same object or event, for example, a child looks at mother’s eyes and then follows her gaze as it shifts to look at a toy across the room Joint attention has been linked to receptive and expressive language proficiency, social initiations, and imitation and may be essential during symbolic play involving two children (White et al., 2011) Social response A response to a social initiation, for example, agreeing to join a game after being invited to play by another child Responding to social initiations is necessary for social interaction and engagement (Matson & Wilkins, 2007) Social initiation An effort to begin a social interaction with another person, for example, tapping someone on the shoulder and asking “do you want to play?” The ability to initiate social interactions affords a child more opportunities for social interaction and forming friendships (Grosberg & Charlop, 2014) Engagement and turn-taking in communication Two people interacting in an ongoing conversation, manipulating the same items (e.g., working together to build a block tower), or other forms of ongoing interaction that typically involve communication, turn-taking, eye contact, and joint attention Engagement is necessary for friendship and provides a context to learn more advanced skills (Koegel, Vernon, Koegel, Koegel, & Paullin, 2012) skill acquisition throughout childhood. In the next section, the characteristics of children with ASD are discussed with a focus on social and play behaviors. Social and Play Behavior in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder The fifth edition of the American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (APA, 2013) provides diagnostic criteria for ASD that includes (a) restricted and/or repetitive behavior involving motor movements (e.g., 1 More Than Just Fun andfiGames: De nition, Development, andfiIntervention… 9 flapping hands), use of objects (e.g., spinning objects like a top), and/or speech (e.g., repetitive vocal sounds) and (b) persistent deficits in social communication and/or social interaction. There has been a focus on the social behavior of children with ASD since autistic disorder was first described (Kanner, 1943). In fact, even the term “autism” is derived from the Greek word for “self” and was used because children in early studies were thought to be absorbed within themselves—favoring social isolation over social interaction. Perhaps some children with ASD prefer social isolation, but a large body of more recent research indicates that most chil- dren with ASD desire social interaction, friendships, and other relationships. It is a mistake to assume that the social skill deficits observed in a person with ASD indi- cate aversion to social interaction or a disinterest
