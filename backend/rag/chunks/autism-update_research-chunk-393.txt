Analyses of a subset of the total participants (n=89) showed similar improvements (Freeman 2010) • Age (younger at baseline), IQ, adaptive behavior, and ASD severity were correlated with outcome; IQ was strongest predictor, accounting for 5-12% of the variance in outcomes (Perry 2011); in sub-set analysis (Shine 2010), duration of intervention also associated with better outcomes • In 151 participants with parental stress data available, higher maternal stress at baseline was correlated with lower child adaptive behavior skills at end of intervention (p<.01) (Shine 2010) • ASD severity improved for G1 vs. G2 as did Vineland composite standard and ratio scores and IQ estimates (p values ≤ .033, effect sizes ranging from 0.53 to 0.83); 19 point difference in IQ at end of intervention in favor of G1 F-7 Author, Year, Country Groups, N Enrollment/N Final Study Quality Age, Mean Months ± SD IQ, Mean ± SD Intervention Provider Intervention Setting Intervention Manualized? Intervention Intensity, Duration, And Focus Key Outcomes • Younger age at intervention and higher adaptive skills associated with better outcomes; adaptive skills also associated with better outcomes for G2. Duration of intervention became nonsignificant after intervention type was entered into statistical models (Flanagan 2012) • In retrospective analyses (Perry 2013), higher baseline IQ predicted gains in IQ, and children starting early intervention at younger ages (2-5 yrs) gained significantly more IQ points (mean 17 points vs. mean 2 points) than children entering intervention at older ages (6-13 yrs); differences in adaptive behavior gains were not significant Boyd et al. 2013 14 US G1: TEACCH preschools, 85/81 G2: LEAP preschools, 54/48 G3: Non-model specific preschools, 59/56 Quality: Fair G1: 48 ± 6.84 G2: 47.52 ± 8.4 G3: 48.84 ± 7.68 NR G1: Teachers in high fidelity TEACCH programs G2: Teachers in high fidelity LEAP programs G3: Teachers in inclusive or special education preschools G1+G2+G3: Preschools G1: Yes G2: Yes G3: No G1: Half or full school day for 6 months of cognitive social learning based
