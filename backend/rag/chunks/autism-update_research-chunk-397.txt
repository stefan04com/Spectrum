Intervention Intensity, Duration, And Focus Key Outcomes G3: Waitlist, 28/28 Quality: Good G1 :Home G2 :Center G3: home/center sessions, 40 weeks duration, six playgroups of 4–6 children, with six concurrent parent support and training groups, focused on communication, social skills, adaptive functioning and psychopathology, parent stress G3: Waiting list expression scores G3 performed better than G1, but not significantly • For the Reynell standard comprehension and expression scores G2 performed better than G3 but not significantly. • G3 improved significantly more G1 on the Vineland socialization scale • There were no statistically significant differences among the three groups for other child outcomes. When analyses were limited only to children with autism spectrum diagnoses, the magnitude of the effects increased but the presence or absence of statistical significance did not. • Parent outcomes: Parenting: statistically significant differences favoring G2 vs. G1 • No significant difference between groups for stress Aldred et al. 2011 25 , 26 UK G1: Parent training in social communication intervention plus community intervention, 14/14 G2: Community intervention, 14/14 Quality: Good G1: 51.4 ± 11.8 G2: 50.9 ± 16.3 NR G1: Speech language therapists, parent G2: Routine care as provided in community— speech pathologists, behavior analyst G1: Clinic, home G2: Community G1: Yes G2: NR G1: Suggested 30 minutes/day parent training, parents received monthly training for 6 months followed by training ~2 months for 6 months, intervention focused on facilitating communication via parental sensitivity and responsiveness, adapted communication strategies, consolidation, elaboration + routine care G2: Intensity NR, routine care including speech • G1 showed improvements in ADOS scores, social interaction, expressive language, child communication acts during interaction • No adaptive behavior differences or differences in parenting stress between groups • Language gains particularly prominent in younger, lower functioning children • Increased parental synchrony (communication which maintained vs. redirected or controlled child responses) in G1 associated with reduction in child ADOS F-13 Author, Year, Country Groups, N Enrollment/N Final Study Quality Age, Mean Months ± SD IQ, Mean ± SD Intervention Provider Intervention Setting Intervention Manualized?
