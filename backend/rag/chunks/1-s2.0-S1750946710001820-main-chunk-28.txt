in individuals with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH; causes excess adrenal androgen production) (e.g., Knickmeyer et al., 2006). Much debate has ensued surrounding this theory and how to evaluate it (Auyeung et al., 2009; Barbeau, Mendrek, & Mottron, 2009; Baron-Cohen, Auyeung, Ashwin, & Knickmeyer, 2009; Falter, Plaisted, & Davis, 2008a, Falter, Plaisted, & Davis, 2008b; Klin, 2009; Knickmeyer, Baron-Cohen, Auyeung, & Ashwin, 2008). Carter (2007) implicated arginine vasopressin (which is androgen-dependent) in the development of ASD traits in males; and further, oxytocin (estrogen-dependent) as protective to females. Yamasue, Kuwabara, Kawakubo, and Kasai (2009) implicated oxytocin, hypothesizing a role in social reciprocity and brain regions implicated in social behaviors. Researchers have recently emphasized additional mechanisms as well (i.e., epigenetics), which may be impacted by a multitude of environmental and biological factors, but also occur independent of hormonal influences (Craig, Harper, & Loat, 2004; Davies & Wilkinson, 2006; Gabory, Attig, & Junien, 2009; Skuse, 2000). These epigenetic mechanisms will be reviewed following. 5.6. X-chromosome epigenetics Given the pronounced sex ratio found in ASD, traditional explanations have been proposed and explored somewhat (e.g., X-linked recessive inheritance, sex limited or sex influenced expression, multifactorial inheritance, death in females, genetic heterogeneity; Miles & Hillman, 2000), though none have fully panned out (Schanen, 2006). While some findings suggest X- chromosome involvement (Jacquemont et al., 2006; Jamain et al., 2003; Klauck et al., 2006; Laumonnier et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2001; Marshall et al., 2008; Shao et al., 2002; Thomas et al., 1999; Vincent et al., 2005), no consistent X-chromosome cause has been identified excluding Rett’s disorder (O’Roak & State, 2008). Given this complexity, researchers have implicated epigenetic theories with evolutionary components (Marco & Skuse, 2006). Epigenetic processes can impact gene expression without changing DNA sequence (Delcuve, Rastegar, & Davie, 2009). Skuse (2006) described a number of epigenetic ways X- linked genes could be implicated in gender differences (e.g., X-inactivation, differential expression of X-linked genes based on chromosomal and gonadal sex, and genomic imprinting). 5.6.1. Imprinting In imprinting, alleles are differentially marked for expression or silencing, which depends on which parent genes are inherited from. As an example, Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome were the first identified disorders in humans involving imprinted genes (Horsthemke & Buiting, 2008). In addition, Rett’s disorder is caused by a mutation in MeCP2 (Amir et al., 1999), a gene involved in imprinting regulation (LaSalle, 2007). Skuse (1999, 2000) and Skuse et al. (1997) proposed the imprinted-X liability threshold model based on findings in females with Turner’s syndrome (monosomy X). Skuse et al. (1997) found that females who had inherited the X from the father (verses the mother) had superior social-communicative skills. The imprinted-X liability threshold model holds that the threshold for expression of ASD symptoms is influenced by an imprinted genetic locus on the X, which influences development of skills needed for social communication. This locus is silent in the one X males get from the mother. In males, having a single X reduces the threshold of ASD phenotypic expression. Females have
