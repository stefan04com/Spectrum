G2 did not show any significant improvement pre- and post- test on Theory of Mind variables • Improvements were maintained at 3-week followup in G1; no significant improvements in G2 • Seven children in the thought bubble intervention group and 1 child in the control group were not available at followup ADOS = Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule; ASD = autism spectrum disorder; G = group; N = number; PDD-NOS = Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified; SD = standard deviation Play/Interaction-Based Interventions Key Points • Twelve studies addressed interaction-based approaches: three good and eight fair quality RCTs and one poor quality prospective cohort. • Studies of interventions targeting joint attention and delivered by teachers, parents, and interventionists reported gains in joint attention skills in treatment groups compared with controls typically over a short duration (8 to 16 weeks). Children in both treatment and comparison groups, typically received early intervention in addition to the targeted intervention. • One small, poor quality study of an intervention targeting pretend play showed an increase in play dialog in both groups, with a greater increase in the intervention group. • Studies targeting parental responsiveness to child communication reported increases in responsive parent behaviors in the treatment arms and limited increases in child communication. Overview of the Literature In addition to seven (reported in nine publications) comparative studies (two RCTs of fair 139- 141 and five of poor 142-147 quality) addressing play- or interaction-based approaches described fully in the 2011 review, we identified 12 studies (reported in 16 papers) evaluating such interventions for the current review (Table 9). Among these 12 studies, one includes a population 48 addressed in the 2011 review. 140 , 141 , 148 , 149 We considered three studies in the current review to be of good quality, 150-153 eight of fair quality, 140 , 141 , 148 , 149 , 154-160 and one of poor quality. 161 Studies were conducted in the United States 140 , 141 , 148-154 , 156-158 , 160 , 161 and Europe 155 , 159 and included a total of 383 participants between the ages of 21 and 82 months. Intervention duration ranged from 6 to 16 weeks; three studies reported long term ( ≥ 12 months post-intervention) followup of participants. 140 , 141 , 148-150 , 156 While all studies used approaches incorporating focused interactions directed by teachers or interventionists 140 , 141 , 148 , 149 , 151-153 , 155 , 157-159 , 161 or parents/caregivers, 150 , 154 , 160 , 162 studies typically addressed outcomes related to joint attention,
