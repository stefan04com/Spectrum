responding to joint attention to a novel individual. Initiation of joint attention did not increase significantly nor did functional play or level of structured play. No potential modifiers (age, ASD severity, mental age) were significantly associated with treatment outcomes. Another fair quality RCT conducted in Belgium included 36 children (18 in each arm) receiving either standard care in low-intensity rehabilitation centers for children with ASD (focus on communication, social skills, play, and motor skills for 3 to 5 hours/week) or standard care + a joint attention- and imitation-focused intervention delivered for 1 hour/week (two 30-minute sessions for a total of 24 sessions). 159 The joint attention/imitation intervention included games and activities to promote following and initiating requests; gaze following; pointing; initiating joint attention; and gestural, vocal, symbolic, or social imitation. Children ranged in age from 4.07 to 6.92 years, with IQs in the average to mild intellectual disability range (50-105 full scale IQ). After 12 weeks of intervention, the joint attention/imitation group had higher total joint attention scores, improved gaze following, and greater request initiations than the treatment as 51 usual group (effect sizes 0.11 to 0.22, all p values ≤.05). The number of elicited joint attention acts increased from 6.53 to 8.41 and the number of spontaneous declarative joint attention acts increased from .89 to 1.72 for the treatment group from baseline to followup; correct imitations increased from 34.11 to 41.12. Initiating declarative joint attention decreased significantly for both groups from baseline to followup (p<.05). Scores on measures of imitation did not differ between groups, though both groups improved over time. Higher baseline verbal IQ was associated with gains in imitation in the treatment group (p<.05), but no other variables tested (age, mental age, full scale IQ, performance IQ, baseline imitation and joint attention skills) were statistically significant. Children in the treatment group improved equally regardless of age or IQ level. Finally, a fair quality RCT of a joint attention intervention assessed the effects of a roughly 7-month home-based parent training approach targeting focusing on faces, reciprocal communication/turn-taking, and joint attention compared with community-based treatment as usual. 160 The 11 participants in the experimental arm had a mean age of 24.6±4 months and mean Mullen expressive language score of 24.6±6.7 (control group: mean age=27.5±3.4, mean expressive language=24.8±6.9). Reported weekly hours, including the joint intervention sessions for experimental group participants ranged from 2.98±1.25 to 17.88±9.06. Hours/week ranged from 6.25±6.49 to 21.35±11.51 in the control arm. At followup 4 weeks post-intervention focusing on faces and responding to joint attention were significantly improved in the treatment group compared with control (p<.001); scores for the treatment arm remained significantly improved vs. the control group from the 4 week to the 8 week followup and from baseline to the 8 week followup. The effect size for between group differences at the 8 week followup on the focusing on faces outcome was 0.84 and 1.18 for responding to joint attention. Effect sizes for initiations of joint attention were not significant. Language outcomes were significantly improved
