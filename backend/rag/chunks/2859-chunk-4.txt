to demonstrate whether technology influences the increase in positive social components and to what extent the results are better due to the use of technology (Pop, Pintea, Vanderborght, & David, 2014; Rice et al.2015). The results of these studies indicate that play was more collaborative in children with ASD under the conditions in which a robot was used (Pop et al., 2014), and there was an improvement in the recognition and mentalization of affect, as well as an improvement in SS under the conditions in which a computer was used (Rice et al. 2015).
