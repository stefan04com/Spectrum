(p<.05) but not IQ, with baseline levels of parenting stress negatively related to language and adaptive outcomes. 108 The Keyhole model incorporated elements of Hanen’s More Than Words and the TEACCH programs. It compared 15 to 18 home visits over a 9 month period (n=35) targeting adaptive skills, ASD symptoms, and parent stress to a lower-intensity intervention model (n=26; 5 home visits, no additional services or supports). Compared with the lower-intensity group, children in the Keyhole intervention showed improved adaptive, imitation, and communication skills, based upon parent report. Mothers in in the Keyhole group also reported improved health but not stress. 97 34 Table 7.
