as a whole? + = yes - = no or not reported (NR) NA or attrition was minimal Considerations: D-12 Were reasons for dropping out evaluated? Does the paper describe a comparison between drop-outs and the whole group? Score as NA if attrition was minimal. Intervention 1. Was the intervention fully described? + = yes - = no or not reported (NR) Considerations: Is there sufficient detail to allow replication of the intervention? Does the study describe the dosage, formulation, timing, duration, intensity, etc. of the intervention? Do the authors refer to a treatment manual (score as YES if so, even is manual is unpublished)? 2. For behavioral studies, was treatment fidelity monitored in a systematic way? + = yes - = no or not reported (NR) NA Considerations: Was a method in place to assess whether people providing he intervention were adherent to a manual/process? We’re not assessing the quality of the fidelity, just whether it was performed. 3. Did the authors measure and report adherence to the intended treatment process? + = yes - = no or not reported (NR) Considerations: Does the study report number of hours of treatment or treatment sessions or time period receiving therapy (planned vs. actually received)? Do they provide pill count data or parental medication diary, etc. for pharmacologic interventions? 4. Did the authors report differences in or hold steady all concomitant interventions? + = yes D-13 - = no or not reported (NR) Considerations: Was an attempt made to assess/determine if other interventions were ongoing? Outcome Measurement 1. Did outcome measures demonstrate adequate reliability and validity (including interobserver reliability for behavior observation coding)? + = yes - = no or not reported (NR) Considerations: If the study used an established measure, has validity been established previously and do the authors provide a reference? If the study used a new measure, was validity established? For interobserver coding, was reliability and /or validity tested? 2. Were the primary & secondary outcomes clearly specified a priori? + = yes - = no or not reported (NR) Considerations: Was there a “called shot?” 3. Were outcome data collected from sources appropriate to the target outcome (e.g. parent report, teacher report, direct behavior observation)? + = yes - = no or not reported (NR) Considerations: Ex: Parent report for home-focused outcomes, teacher report for academic/school-focused, etc. 4. Were outcomes coded by individuals blinded to the intervention status of the participants? + = yes - = no or not reported (NR) Analysis 1. Was an appropriate statistical analysis used? D-14 + = yes - = no 1a. For RCT’s, was there an intent-to treat analysis? + = yes - = no NA Considerations: Does the study report ITT analyses or last observation carried forward or note that all subjects were included in the final analyses? If ≤2 participants were lost to follow -up, consider the analysis as ITT. 1b. For negative studies, was a power calculation provided? + = yes - = no NA 1c. Did the
