133 Detailed Analysis Four fair quality RCTs conducted in the United States addressed group-based social skills approaches. 126 , 127 , 129 , 136 Among these, three studies evaluated the manualized Skillstreaming model (Table 8). 127 , 129 , 136 The studies included between 13 and 52 total participants, all of whom were considered to be high-functioning, and most of whom were male. One RCT compared a manualized performance-based approach, Sociodramatic Affective Relational Intervention, versus the knowledge-based Skillstreaming social skills intervention, which emphasizes social skills, face-emotion recognition, interest expansion, and interpretation of non-literal language. The study included 13 boys with ASD between the ages of 9 and 12. Weekly 90-minute sessions treatment sessions were held over 4 weeks after school. Treatment sessions, regardless of the intervention, included content covering considering others, emotions, consolidating, and generalization of skills. Participants in both groups increased in reciprocal friendship nominations (p=.027) and staff-reported social skills (effect size=0.59, p=.002). Participants in the sociodramatic group interacted more with each and rated one another more favorably after one session, which slightly decreased over time (effect size=0.70, p=.001). Skillstreaming 40 participants also demonstrated gains in interactions and more favorable ratings over the course of the intervention, but at a slower rate as compared with the sociodramatic group (effect size=0.37, p=.001). No significant differences in parent report of social functioning were demonstrated for either group. 129 A second RCT 127 examined the short-term outcome of a 5-week trial of the Skillstreaming approach and replicates the intervention reported in a study 115 described in our 2011 review. The study included 36 children (mean age=9.47), primarily male (94% of the total sample) with high functioning ASD (mean IQ=103) randomized either to Skillstreaming or a wait-list control group. Participants in the treatment group showed significant improvements in most parent-rated measures of social skills compared with the control group (Social Responsiveness Scale: effect size=0.625, p=.003; Adapted Skillstreaming Checklist: effect size=0.584, p=.006; Behavioral Assessment System for Children (BASC)-Withdrawal scale: effect size=1.055, p<.001); however, group differences on the BASC-Social Skills scale were not significant. Staff-report measures found similar outcomes, with significant improvements in ASD symptomology and program-targeted social skills, as well as a decrease in withdrawn behaviors in the treatment group compared with the control arm (effect sizes ranging from 0.69 to 1.4, p values ≤.007). Child-rated measures similarly improved in the Skillstreaming group compared with control (Skillstreaming Knowledge Assessment: effect size=1.272, p<.001; understanding of idioms: effect size=0.390, p<.001). 127 Another RCT replicating the Skillstreaming model reported by Lopata et al. 127 included 35 children with high functioning ASD between the ages of 7 and 12. 136 Skillstreaming involved five 70-minute sessions treatment sessions per weekday over 5 weeks. Treatment sessions involved skill instruction (nonliteral language and face-emotion recognition) and practice as well as a behavioral system to encourage participation and decrease problem behaviors. Weekly 90- minute parent trainings were also conducted, which involved education on ASD as well as training on the treatment program.
