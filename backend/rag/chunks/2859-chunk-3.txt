sessions, in most cases, with one or two weekly sessions, aimed at children between 4 and 13 years old, depending on the article reviewed, and with positive results, in one way or another, in all cases. These are summarized in the “Results” column of Table 1. The PEERS program (Program of Education and Enrichment of Relational Skills) is one of those most used to work on aspects such as personal interaction, interpersonal relationship, social communication, response, and social motivation (Chang et al., 2014; Karst et al., 2015; Laugeson, Ellingsen, Sanderson, Tucci, & Bates, 2014; Schol et al., 2014; Yoo et al., 2014). Another of the intervention programs that stands out is the Superhero Social Skills Program, which works on areas similar to those of the PEERS program, with the difference of achieving longer term results, as well as their generalization (Block, Radley, Jenson, Clark, & O’Neill, 2015; Radley, Jenson, Clark, & O’Neill, 2014; Radley et al., 2014; Radley, Ford, Battaglia, & McHugh, 2014; Radley et al., 2015; Radley, Dart, Moore, Battaglia, & LaBrot, 2017). Other outstanding interventions are the Social Skills Training (SST) and the Secret Agent Society (SAS). Both programs specify the main objective of improving social functioning for everyday situations (Beaumont, Rotolone, & Sofronoff, 2015; Deckers, Muris, Roelofs, & Arntz, 2016; Dekker et al., 2014; Tan, Mazzucchelli, & Beaumont, 2015). Several of the studies in the present review note the involvement of the family as a fundamental aspect when carrying out any type of SS intervention (Butterwort et al., 2014; INMACULADA MARCH-MIGUEZ, MAITE MONTAGUT-ASUNCIÓN, GEMMA PASTOR-CEREZUELA AND MARÍA INMACULADA FERNÁNDEZ-ANDRÉS 141 A r t i c l e s SOCIAL SKILLS OF CHILDREN WITH ASD 142 A r t i c l e s Haven, Manangan, Sparrow, & Wilson, 2014; Laugeson et al., 2014; McMahon & Solomon, 2015; Olçay-Gül & Tekin-Iftar, 2016), as well as working on the affective component. Therefore, they suggest working on concepts such as friendships, self-acceptance, self-esteem, anxiety, or depression (Butterwort et al. 2014; Demopoulos, Hopkins, & Lewine, 2016; Mandelberg, Frankel, Cunningham, Gorospe, & Laugeson, 2014; Ratcliffe, Wong, Dossetor, & Hayes, 2014; Rodríguez, Martín, Carbonero, & Ovejero, 2016; Sofronoff, Silva, & Beaumont, 2017). Other studies talk about more specific intervention techniques such as working with social stories, which turns out to be very useful when modifying social behaviors. These studies show that although improvised stories –which have sometimes been used in the past for SS work in children with ASD– are useful, the most efficient social stories are ones that have been prepared (Malmberg, Charlop, & Gershfeld, 2015; Olçay-Gül & Tekin- Iftar, 2016). Also, two of the reviewed studies highlight training techniques for the recognition of facial expressions, fundamental in being able to communicate and understand the message, an area in which many children with ASD show deficits (Chen, Lee, & Lin, 2015; Rice, Wall, Fogel, & Shic, 2015). Finally, two other studies talk about a SS training program that includes the use of technology. One of the objectives proposed in these studies is
