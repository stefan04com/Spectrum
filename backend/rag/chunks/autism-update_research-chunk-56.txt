Overall, the quality of the studies improved in comparison to the 2011 review. Two studies were rated as good quality, while 10 studies were fair quality, and one was poor. • Most studies included school-aged children, without concomitant intellectual disability or language deficits. Most children had average cognitive skills (IQ>70). • Most studies reported short-term gains in social skills and emotion recognition as reported by parents or within study measures. Maintenance and generalization of skills beyond the treatment context was addressed within the majority of the studies, but with variable results. • The diversity of the intervention protocols and assessments utilized to measure outcomes continues to be a limiting factor for determining effectiveness of social skills interventions. Overview of the Literature In addition to the nine comparative studies assessing social skills included in the 2011 review, eight RCTs of fair 114-116 and poor 117-121 quality and one poor quality retrospective cohort 122 ), 13 studies of good, 123 , 124 fair, 117 , 125-134 and poor 135 quality addressed interventions targeting social skills. Followup data for one study reported in the original review is included in this update. 117 , 134 Studies addressed in the current review included a total of roughly 462 participants (mean/study=36). Seven RCTs were conducted in the United States, 117 , 124-127 , 129 , 134 , 136 one in Europe, 137 one in Japan, 135 and two in Australia. 123 , 132 Two nonrandomized studies were also conducted in Australia. 131 , 133 Participant ages across studies ranged from 4 to 13 years, and participants typically had high functioning ASD (IQ>70). Studies assessed group-based approaches including replications of studies evaluating the Skillstreaming model; 126 , 127 , 129 , 136 the Children’s Friendship Training model; 117 , 134 a Japanese pilot RCT of the Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) model; 135 incorporated peer-mediated components; 124 , 125 , 138 and targeted emotion recognition in children with ASD. 123 , 128 , 132 ,
