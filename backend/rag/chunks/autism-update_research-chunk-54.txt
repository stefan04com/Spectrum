Good G1: 36.38±7.54 G2: 35.71±6.92 G1: 53.06±9.06 G2: 52.86±6.53 • G1 showed significantly greater improvement on social communication at followup than G2 regardless of values at baseline • Parents low in self-efficacy at baseline demonstrated relatively higher levels of self-efficacy if they received G1 vs. G2 • G1 reduced child-related stress relative to G2 for both mothers and fathers • Fathers reported higher levels of stress than mothers in both groups. • Behavior sample scores at followup not affected by group condition • All outcomes are based on parent report.

In analyses by group, age and hours of intervention associated with improvements in vocabulary for G1 (p≤.05) Reed et al. 2012 95 UK G1: ABA, 14 G2: Special nursery, 21 G3: Portage, 18 G4: Local authority- developed parent training, 13 Quality: Fair G1: 39.0±6.9 G2: 41.5±4.0 G3: 39.5±6.3 G4: 40.2±6.3 G1: 55.1±17.3 G2: 52.2±17.1 G3: 54.0±15.4 G4: 51.7±14.5 • Scores on cognitive and adaptive measures were not significantly different among groups • Scores on British Abilities Scale improved for G1 vs. G2-G4 (p<.05) • Composite change scores (mean of change scores on cognitive, adaptive, and educational measures) were not statistically significantly different across
