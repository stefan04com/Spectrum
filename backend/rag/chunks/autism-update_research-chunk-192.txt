group performed similar to the overall analysis, including treatment effects on total Theory of Mind score (p<0.05), elementary Theory of Mind tasks (p<0.05), understanding of mixed emotions and complex emotions (both p<0.05). The high-functioning autism/Asperger group only showed improvement on understanding of complex emotions (p<0.01). No effect of ASD diagnostic group on self-reported empathy or parent reported social skills. C-136 Table C-1.
