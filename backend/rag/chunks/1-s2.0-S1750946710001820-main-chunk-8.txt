addressed gender as it relates to core symptom presentation. The present review will present background on ASD, such as diagnostic classifications and prevalence, a brief discussion of assessment considerations and findings of gender differences in typically developing children in relevant domains, and finally, an in depth review of the literature base on the nature and etiology of gender differences in ASD. 1.1. Diagnostic classifications and prevalence The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2000) includes five disorders under the category of Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD): autistic T.T. Rivet, J.L. Matson / Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders 5 (2011) 957–976 958 disorder; Asperger’s disorder; PDD not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS); Rett’s disorder; and childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD). Rett’s disorder and CDD are both rare disorders characterized by the presence of regression in skills (Volkmar, State, & Klin, 2009). Moreover, Rett’s and CDD are typically not viewed as included under ASD (Matson & Mahan, 2009; Volkmar et al., 2009). Core symptoms of ASD include qualitative impairments in social interaction and communication, and restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interest, or activities (Brim, Townsend, DeQuinzio & Paulson, 2009; Loukusa & Moilanen, 2009; Matson, Matson & Rivet, 2007; Niklasson, Rasmussen, Oskarsdottir, & Gillberg, 2009. Rett’s disorder is unique in that it is the only PDD that occurs almost exclusively in females and has an identified genetic cause (Amir et al., 1999; Hagberg, Aicardi, Dias, & Ramos, 1983; Rett, 1966). Most individuals (most estimates are approximately 95% ranging from 85 to 100%) with classic Rett’s disorder have MECP2 (methyl-CpG binding protein) mutations at Xq28 (Deidrick, Percy, Schanen, Mamounas, & Maria, 2005; Erlandson & Hagberg, 2005). Diagnosis of Rett’s disorder must be made clinically, as MECP2 mutations result in a wide variety of phenotypes within and outside of Rett’s disorder (Erlandson & Hagberg, 2005; Hagberg, Hanefeld, Percy, & Skjeldal, 2002; Hammer, Dorrani, Dragich, Kudo, & Schanen, 2002; Matson, Dempsey, & Wilkins, 2008; Matson, Fodstad, & Boisjoli, 2008). Regarding prevalence, no epidemiological study (excluding Rett’s disorder) has yielded more females than males (Fombonne, 2003, 2007). The male to female ratio has ranged from 1.33:1 (16:12; McCarthy, Fitzgerald, & Smith, 1984) to 16:1 (Wing, Yeates, Brierley, & Gould, 1976) (average 4.3:1; Fombonne, 2003, 2005, 2007). This varies according to cognitive ability, with a median sex ratio of 5.5:1 for IQ in the normal range, compared to 1.95:1 for moderate to severe intellectual disability (ID) (Fombonne, 2005, 2007). The co-occurrence of ID and ASD in general has been an important topic. It has frequently been reported that the majority with autism have ID; however, current rates may be lower than previous estimates (Bryson, Bradley, Thompson, & Wainwright, 2008; Edelson, 2006; Ritvo & Ritvo, 2006). 2. Gender issues in ASD assessment A number of considerations are important relative to gender differences in ASD assessment. Koenig and Tsatsanis (2005) pointed out that gender differences in presentation have not been sufficiently addressed in studies of key instruments used in the field such
