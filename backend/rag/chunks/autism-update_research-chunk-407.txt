preschools, specialty schools, mainstream public schools, and research centers in the US, Belgium, and Norway. Table G-5. Applicability of studies evaluating other behavioral approaches Domain Description of applicability of evidence Population Studies of neurofeedback included children between the ages of 8-12 years and had IQs in the average range (>70); children were recruited from a special education school and from the community. Studies of sleep interventions included children between 2 and 10 years of age. Participants were drawn from the Autism Treatment Network and from children attending a pediatrics and psychiatry clinic. Participants were generally reflective of the larger population of children with ASD and sleep issues. One study included young children (36-104 months) who may have issues with feeding/mealtime. Intervention Interventions included neurofeedback training, a sleep education pamphlet, and CBT with and without melatonin, parent education in sleep hygiene and in promoting appropriate mealtime behaviors. Comparators Comparators included no treatment/waiting list, group vs. individual training, and in one sleep study, melatonin alone, CBT+melatonin, or placebo. Outcomes Outcomes in neurofeedback studies included measures of executive function and social and communication skills. Sleep studies assessed sleep parameters including night wakings, time to fall asleep, sleep duration, and sleep anxiety. The feeding study assessed mealtime behaviors such as food acceptance. Setting Studies were set in the home and treatment centers in the US, the Netherlands, and Italy. G-4
