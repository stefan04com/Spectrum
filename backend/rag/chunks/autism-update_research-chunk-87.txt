Modifiers of Treatment Effects Key Points • Not all studies were adequately designed or powered to assess modifiers of effects. • Associations of outcome and baseline measures of cognition, adaptive behavior, language, and ASD severity were mixed across studies. • In early intervention studies, younger age was associated with greater improvements, though effects were not always consistent. Overview of the Literature Understanding the degree to which child characteristics (i.e., specific ASD-related difficulties and skills), treatment factors (e.g., type, duration, intensity), and systems (e.g., family, community) influence response to treatments could improve targeting of treatments to the appropriate children and circumstances. Twenty papers (described in multiple publications) reported predictor, moderator, or mediator data; 72 , 76 , 77 , 79 , 81-84 , 86 , 87 , 90 , 93 , 95 , 100 , 101 , 105 , 123 , 124 , 132 , 152 , 153 , 156 , 159 , 167 , 179-181 , 183 however, not all studies were adequately designed or powered to assess modifiers of effects. Detailed Analysis Child-Related Factors Age As in the 2011 review, several studies reported associations between age at intake and improved outcomes. In one RCT of an approach incorporating parent training, younger age was associated with greater improvements: greater language gains were seen in children who were younger with lower functioning levels at baseline. 72 , 105 Age effects were not consistent, however, and may reflect characteristics of subgroups and treatment characteristics that need further elucidation. For example, one study comparing preschool-delivered intensive early intervention and treatment as usual reported larger adaptive behavior gains for older children in the early intervention group. 77 Another RCT compared early intensive treatment delivered by parents and by specialized center staff with eclectic treatment and identified predictors of progress: in the parent training group, older children achieved better adaptive behavior outcomes; younger children made more
