Put simply, to be considered an evidence-based practice, a treatment’s beneficial outcomes must have been peer-reviewed, replicated across studies, and replicated across researchers. Using these criteria, the NPDC examined hundreds of peer-reviewed studies and identified 24 specific intervention components and treatment packages (Table 2.1). Of these 24 practices that met the NPDC’s definition of evidence-based, 16 have been
