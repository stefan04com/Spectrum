but no between group differences • Initiating declarative joint attention significantly decreased in both groups from baseline to followup (p<.05) • Verbal IQ significantly correlated with growth in imitation for G1 (p<.05); age, mental age, full scale IQ baseline imitation and joint attention skills, performance IQ were not significant modifiers of outcomes Schertz et al. 2013 160 US G1: Joint attention-focused parent training, 11/11 G2: Treatment as usual, 12/12 Quality: Fair G1: 24.6±4.0 G2: 27.5±3.4 NR • Scores on responding to joint attention significantly improved for G1 vs. G2 at 4-week post-intervention followup (effect size for differences=1.39), as were scores on focusing on faces (effect size=1.24); effects sizes at 8-week followup were 1.18 (responding to joint attention) and .84 (faces) • Mullen receptive language and Vineland communication significantly improved for G1 but not G2; effect sizes for 4 week differences=.59 (Vineland) and .34 (Mullen) • Mullen expressive language improved in both groups from baseline to followup (p<.027) 55 Table 9. Summary of outcomes of studies of play/interaction-based interventions (continued) Author, Year, Country Groups, N Enrollment/N Final Study Quality Age, Mean Months±SD IQ, Mean±SD Key Outcomes Joint attention studies Kasari et al. 2012 140 , 141 , 148 , 149 US G1: Joint attention intervention, 20/20 G2: Symbolic play intervention, 16/16 G3: Control, 16/16 Quality: Fair G1: 43.05±6.863 G2: 41.41±6.491 G3: 41.31±4.542 NR • Joint attention interventions delivered by interventionists; children in the intervention groups showed greater growth in expressive language, initiation of joint attention, and duration of child- initiated joint attention than did control group children (p=<.01, <.05); receptive language growth not significantly affected by intervention • Amount of intervention services received post- intervention was not related to growth in skills at followup 12 months after the ~6 week intervention, except for child-initiated joint attention: children receiving fewer hours of additional services showed greater growth in child-initiated joint attention • Quality of joint attention (shared positive affect, shared positive affect with utterances) improved in G1 and G2 at 6 an 12 month followups • At followup of 40/58 participants 5-years post- intervention, 32/40 had passing scores on the Expressive Vocabulary Test of spoken language; only baseline play level predicted ability to use spoken language. • Younger age at baseline, initiation of joint attention, and play level were predictors of spoken language ability at 5-year followup • Greater functional play types at baseline predicted better overall cognitive ability at 5-year followup Pretend play studies Murdock et al. 2011 161 US G1: Pretend play intervention, 6/6 G2: Comparison, 6/6 Quality: Poor G1: 69.33±5.9889 G2: 62.17±6.2102 NR • Intervention included typically developing peers as play models • Both groups gained play dialog skills from baseline to followup (p=.003), with greater gains in G1 vs. G2 (260% vs. 136%, p=.041) • Participants were able to generalize play dialog skills to a toy not used in the intervention (p=.012) with an increase in play dialog utterances Imitation studies Ingersoll. 2010 152 , 153 US G1: Reciprocal imitation training, 15/14 G2: Control, 14/13 Quality: Good G1:
