12.7±19.4, effect size=0.81, p<.001, respectively), but there was no significant change in ASD symptom severity based on the ADOS. A fair quality prospective cohort study 95 compared outcomes for four different types of intervention after 9 months of treatment: 1:1 home-based, manualized ABA (n=14, mean age=39±6.9 months); special education classroom enrollment (n=21, mean age=41.5±4.0 months); comparatively low-intensity, home-based, manualized behavioral intervention ( “portage;” n=18, mean age 39.5±6.3 months), and 1:1 behavioral intervention (“local authority”) that included an intensive introductory 5-day parent training component (n=13, mean age=40.2±6.3 months). The home-based ABA group received an average of 30.4 hours/week of intervention, 28.3 of which were 1:1. The special education group received an average of 12.7 hours/week (3.1 hours 1:1). The portage group received an average of 8.5 hours/week (6.5 1:1), and the local authority group received an average of 12.6 hours/week (12.2 1:1). Participants were not receiving any other teaching interventions during the study. Post-treatment, mean cognitive and adaptive scores were not significantly different across groups. Children in the home-based ABA group showed significant improvements in educational outcomes as measured by the British Abilities Scale relative to other groups (p<.05). The authors created composite scores based on cognitive, adaptive, and educational functioning, but between- group comparisons only approached significance (p<.06). Baseline ASD severity and total intervention hours did modify effects of treatment significantly. First, baseline ASD severity was inversely related to composite change scores for all but the home-based ABA group and was positively related that group. That is, children with more severe ASD symptoms made more progress in ABA and less in the other intervention groups. Second, more intervention time was negatively related to composite change scores for children in ABA but not in the other groups. More hours of ABA were associated with less progress relative to school enrollment or other home-based interventions. 95 One fair quality U.S. RCT (reported in two papers) compared parent-delivered ESDM to community-based treatment-as-usual. 98 , 106 The ESDM group included 49 children (mean age 21.02±3.51 months, mean developmental quotient [DQ]=64.88±17.22); their parents completed 12 1-hour sessions that included manualized parent-training and coaching. Both the ESDM group and the community group (N=49; mean age=20.94±3.42 months, mean DQ=63.08±15.93) continued receiving community-based treatment-as-usual services as well, including the Developmental, Individual Difference, Relationship-based (DIR) model, TEACCH, ABA, and occupational and speech therapies (range of hours: 0-15.9), with the community group receiving significantly more intervention hours at the second time point (mean 3.68 vs. 1.48; p<.05). Compared with the ESDM group, children in the community-based arm had more severe social affect deficits, poorer imitation skills, and higher nonsocial orienting scores at baseline (p<.05). After treatment, both groups showed improvement in DQ and ADOS Social Affect scores with no main effects of group assignment. Both groups of parents showed significant increases in parent-child interaction behaviors, with greater increases in the ESDM group (effect size=.57) than the community-based group (.37). ). Parents in the ESDM group reported significantly less parenting stress at followup (p=.04) but did not report more parenting competence.
