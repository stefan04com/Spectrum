effective approaches to teaching play. Table 1.2 overviews the categories and definitions of play appearing the most often in inter- vention research aimed at improving play. An approximate age range during which each form of play may be observed in typical child development is also provided. However, due to differences in how play is defined or measured across research studies, there is no single agreed-upon taxonomy for play in the scientific literature. Table 1.2 Developmental sequence of play behavior Approximate age range observed Type of play Definition and example topography 0–6+ months Sensorimotor play Exploring the environment by touching and mouthing objects. For example, putting hands or objects in mouth and rubbing hand on a bumpy wall 3–9+ months Object exploration play Seeing an object, reaching for that object, and then manually or orally manipulating the object 4–12+ months Simple functional play Engaging with objects (toys) in the manner intended, for example, pressing buttons on a light-up toy and shaking a rattle 8–12+ months Relational or combination functional play Making two or more objects interact or combine in some way, for example, stacking blocks 9–18+ months Functional or pre-symbolic play Using a toy in a way consistent with what the toy represents, for example, putting sand in the bucket of a toy dump truck 12–18+ months Symbolic, imaginative, or pretend play Using an object as if it were a different object (e.g., a book as a race car ramp); acting as though an object has an attribute it lacks (e.g., a toy oven imagined to be hot); or an object or person that is not present is imagined to be there or an event that did not occur to have occurred (e.g., a dragon is attacking the castle but no item represents the dragon) 18–24+ months Dramatic or self-pretend play Pretending to be someone or something else, for example, pretending to be a superhero or animal 24 months to 3 years Parallel play Playing alongside another child but not directly interacting with the other child 2.5 years to 4 years+ Associative play or early cooperative play Seeking out other children to play with, has clear preferences for play partners but may still require adult support for more than brief play interactions 4 years+ Cooperative play Playing with other children unassisted; able to identify friends and shows concern for whether or not other children like them Typical Social and Play Development 6 As such, Table 1.2 is intended only to provide a sampling of various play taxono- mies and multiple theoretical underpinnings (Barton, 2010; Belsky & Most, 1981; Lifter et al., 2011; Malone, 1997; McCune, 1998; Rutherford & Rogers, 2003). As previously noted, play provides a naturally reinforcing context for children to practice emerging motor, communication, social, problem-solving, and other essen- tial skills throughout childhood (Freeman & Kasari, 2013; Warreyn, Paelt, & Roeyers, 2014; White et al., 2011). Beginning very early in life, infants learn about the appearance, taste, and feel of objects during sensorimotor play. Natural rein- forcement contingencies involving
