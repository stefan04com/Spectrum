brain areas. Ten children served as controls (mean age=9.14±1.34 years); the study did not specify if control children received any type if intervention. 192 In contrast to the prior neurofeedback study, children had diagnoses across the ASD spectrum, treatment occurred in school and at home, and both parents and teachers completed outcome questionnaires. Immediately after treatment, theta activity was reduced in 60 percent of the intervention group. Social behavior, especially reciprocal social interaction, as measured on the parent-rated Social Communication Questionnaire, improved for the treatment group compared with control (p<.05) as did scores on the Children’s Communication Checklist and on the set-shifting domain of executive function (p<.05). Scores on other domains of executive function did not differ between group nor did scores on teacher-rated measures. At followup 6-months post-treatment, the intervention group showed continued improvement on parent-rated measures of social behavior, communication, and repetitive behavior as well as set-shifting compared with the control arm (p<.05) Parents were not blinded to treatment condition. 68 Finally, one poor quality RCT assessed the effectiveness of an 8-week manualized parent training program on mealtime behaviors. 191 Baseline BMI among the 19 participants (age range 68-91 months) was in the normal range. Between group differences at followup were not significantly different on any mealtime behavior measures. Parenting stress was significantly reduced in the treatment group compared with the waitlist control (p=.01). Table 11.
