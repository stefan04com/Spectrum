this genetic variability, while females may show these features only as a result of some type of pathology. This model would predict higher rates of identifiable organic conditions in females compared to males with ASD. In support of this, Wing (1981) found that identifiable organic conditions were more frequently associated with profound ID in girls versus severe/moderate ID in boys. However, Tsai and Beisler (1983) examined the percentages and rates of organic conditions based on Wing’s (1981) data, and found them similar overall in boys and girls (56% and 65%, respectively). When IQ was below 50, rates for boys and girls (67% and 68%) were similar (Tsai & Beisler, 1983; Wing, 1981). In participants with IQ above 50, boys had more identifiable organic conditions (27% versus 0%); however, only one girl was included (Tsai & Beisler, 1983; Wing, 1981). Finally, inconsistent with Wing’s (1981) prediction, Schendel et al. (2009) found higher sex ratios in children with ASD and major birth defects; however, the ratio was lower in those with a ASD and ID compared to ASD only. Wing’s (1981) genetic variability hypothesis has not been further researched directly. However, researchers have expanded upon the notion of greater genetic variability in males in relation to epigenetic hypotheses (see X-inactivation/X- linkage and X-linked male extremes hypotheses below). Rutter et al. (2003) pointed out that genetic variability has been posed as an explanation for a number of disorders, though without substantial systematic research evidence. Regarding Wing’s (1981) hypotheses about gender differences in pathology and ID in ASD, some related data, albeit limited, has emerged. This area of research is impacted by the type of pathology and related ID, rare conditions resulting in small sample sizes, and sex linked genetics. In children without physical anomalies and/or an identified syndrome or etiology (essential versus complex autism), Miles et al. (2005) found more males compared to females, higher IQ, and more ASD relatives. Based on this data, Beaudet (2007) noted that the gender ratio in cases with identified genetic mutations is likely equal. In contrast, Schendel et al. (2009) found a higher sex ratio in children with ASD and major birth defects. 5.3. Language and visuospatial skills Wing (1981) described another hypothesis of gender differences in ASD based on available research at that time on gender differences in typically developing populations. She quoted Asperger (1944) describing the syndrome as ‘‘an extreme T.T. Rivet, J.L. Matson / Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders 5 (2011) 957–976 967 variant of male intelligence and male character’’ (Wing, 1981, p. 135). Wing (1981) reported that in the general population, females have better language skills, and poorer visuospatial and math skills. Males may be more susceptible to communication deficits such as those in ASD, but more likely to have useful visuospatial abilities (Wing, 1981). Females may be less vulnerable to communication deficits, but those with ASD may have fewer compensating visuospatial skills and be more likely to have profound ID (Wing, 1981). Wing (1981) further noted that visuospatial skills may be implicated
