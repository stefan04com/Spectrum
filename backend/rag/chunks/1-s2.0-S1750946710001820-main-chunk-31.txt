problems, peer problems, and cognitive ability). 5.6.4. Skewed X-chromosome inactivation Researchers have investigated non-random, or skewed, X-chromosome inactivation. In an initial investigation using peripheral blood cells, Talebizadeh, Bittel, Veatch, Kibiryeva, and Butler (2005) found that skewed X-inactivation was more common in females with autism than without autism, and was more heritable in females with autism compared to general population rates. In contrast, Gong et al. (2008) did not replicate this. Using frontal cortex and blood samples, Nagarajan et al. (2008) did not find more frequent X-inactivation skew in females with autism or mothers of males with autism. However, further research is needed using a variety of samples and methodologies (Nagarajan et al., 2008). Finally, the role of X-linked genes which escape inactivation in the etiology of gender differences in ASD has not been explored (Gong et al., 2008). 5.6.5. Mosaic X-chromosome aneuploidy Iourov, Vorsanova, and Yurov (2006) and Iourov, Yurov, and Vorsanova (2008) hypothesized that the sex ratio in ASD was the result of an abnormal number (aneuploidy) of X-chromosomes in some cells (mosaicism) in the brain. One study found that unexplained autism in males was associated with low-level mosaic aneuploidy in peripheral blood cells (Yurov et al., 2007). 5.7. Sporatic and inherited genetic models Researchers have discussed gender differences in ASD as related to sporadic (simplex) versus inherited or familial (multiplex) models. These models have been examined in relation to essential (idiopathic) versus complex (syndromic) autism (Miles et al., 2005), and inherited versus de novo copy number variations (CNV; non-inherited sequence changes in T.T. Rivet, J.L. Matson / Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders 5 (2011) 957–976 970 sections of DNA; Jacquemont et al., 2006; Marshall et al., 2008; Sebat et al., 2007; Zhao et al., 2007). Beaudet (2007) discussed Miles and Hillman’s (2000), Miles et al.’s (2005) findings along with recent findings of de novo CNV (Jacquemont et al., 2006; Sebat et al., 2007). Beaudet (2007) estimated that only half of these de novo mutations have been identified. Furthermore, the gender ratio in cases with identified mutations is likely equal, excluding X-linked disorders (Beaudet, 2007). This leaves a large number of people with ASD without identified DNA sequence changes, a group which is predominately male, with higher IQs and normal features in appearance (Beaudet, 2007). Thus, overall, Beaudet (2007) proposed a mixed etiology model for autism, where each case could have genetic or epigenetic mutations which could be de novo or inherited. Similarly, Zhao et al. (2007) proposed ‘‘a unified genetic theory for sporadic and inherited autism,’’ comprised of two groups. The vast majority of ASD occurs in simplex (low-risk or sporadic) families resulting from de novo mutations which have poor penetrance in females (i.e., they have the mutation but do not express the clinical phenotype) and high penetrance in males (Zhao et al., 2007). A small minority of ASD occurs in multiplex (high-risk or inherited) families, where female carriers transmit the mutation dominantly, and the risk to male offspring is 50/50 (Zhao et al., 2007).
