in severity of impairment related to autistic symptoms, cognitive ability, and adaptive skills in ASD have not been determined (Koenig & Tsatsanis, 2005). Future research should examine gender differences in ASD symptom presentation across a wide span of development, include comparison groups of both males and females without ASD, which is important given increasing evidence for the presence of autistic traits in the general population. Finally, a fine-grained analysis of ASD symptoms is warranted, considering emerging data of the fractionability of the triad of impairments. Research in this area has significant implications informing assessment and intervention for females with ASD. Differences may manifest with regard to symptom domains, breadth of symptoms, symptom severity, developmental changes in symptom presentation, course, and so forth. This information is important clinically to improve identification and knowledge, and work towards addressing diagnostic pitfalls with females with ASD (e.g., validity of the diagnostic criteria, assessment instruments, comorbidity biases, informant biases in report, expectations, and socialization). In addition, gender differences related to intervention needs, prioritized areas, and potential targets for intervention may become evident. This information is important in both clinical and research realms regarding diagnosis and treatment. As there is a paucity of research, these data would serve to stimulate future research priorities in gender differences in ASD symptoms.
