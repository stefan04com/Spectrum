good, 1 fair, 1 poor (142) Study limitations: Medium Consistency: Inconsistent Directness: Direct Precision: Imprecise Reporting bias: Undetected Other concerns: None Most studies of parent-implemented ABA demonstrated no improvements in IQ relative to community-based interventions; in some studies worse outcomes were reported relative to center-based treatment. SOE is low for no effect due to heterogeneity in interventions and outcomes measured. Symptom severity Low for positive effect RCT: 3 good, 3 fair (361) Prospective cohort: 1 good, 1 fair, 2 poor, (203) Study limitations: Low Consistency: Inconsistent Directness: Direct Precision: Imprecise Reporting bias: Undetected Other concerns: The measure of symptom severity varied across studies and was inconsistently defined. Many studies found that treatment groups had improved ASD symptoms relative to controls. Language/ commun- ication Low for positive effect RCT: 4 good, 6 fair, 1 poor (664) nRCT: 1 poor (22) Prospective cohort: 2 good, 2 poor (176) Study limitations: Low Consistency: Inconsistent Directness: Direct Precision: Precise Reporting bias: Undetected Other concerns: A mix of outcome measures was used—both parent reported (Vineland Scales of Adaptive Behavior) and more standardized measures such as Reynell or Mullen scales. Parent training was associated with improvements in language (low SOE for improvements), but interventions and comparators were different across studies, as were the outcome measures. More studies are needed to confirm results. . Social s kills Social skills/ social behavior Low for positive effect RCT: 2 good, 11 fair, 6 poor (730) nRCT: 2 fair (45) Retrospective cohort: 1 poor (117) Study limitations: Medium Consistency: Inconsistent Directness: Direct Precision: Precise Reporting bias: Undetected Other concerns: Interventions varied widely in terms of scope and intensity. School-aged children diagnosed without concomitant cognitive and language deficits demonstrated short- term gains in social skills and emotion recognition. Maintenance and generalization of these skills beyond the treatment context had variable results. ES-14 Table B. Strength of the evidence (SOE) (continued) Intervention Outcome SOE Study Design Quality (N participants) Ratings for Domains Used to Assess SOE, and Issues Key Findings Play/interaction based interventions Joint attention Moderate for positive effect RCT: 3 good, 6 fair (305) Study limitations: Low Consistency: Consistent Directness: Indirect Precision: Precise Reporting bias: Undetected Other concerns: Children in several studies were also receiving other early intervention; disentangling results is difficult. Selected joint attention skills consistently increased in treatment arms, but duration of effects is unclear. The SOE is lowered to moderate, as children in most studies were also receiving other early intervention and disentangling effects is difficult. Play skills Low for positive effect RCT: 3 good, 3 fair, 3 poor (265) Prospective cohort: 1 poor (12) Study limitations: Medium Consistency: Consistent Directness: Direct Precision: Precise Reporting bias: Undetected Other concerns: Children in several studies were also receiving other early intervention; disentangling results is difficult. Play skills increased in treatment arms but duration of effects is unclear. Imitation skills improved in treatment arms in 4 small short-term studies and in the treatment and control arms in 1 study.
