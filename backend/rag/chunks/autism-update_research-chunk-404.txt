Applicability Tables Table G-1. Applicability of early intensive behavioral and developmental intervention studies Domain Description of applicability of evidence Population Studies included both toddlers and preschool children (i.e., children from 2-5 years; range of mean ages: 20.94 – 55.7 months). Baseline cognitive, language, and adaptive scores typically fell within the impaired range, reflecting characteristics of young children with ASD in the community. Most participants were male. Where reported, other population demographic characteristics were mixed regarding race, ethnicity, language spoken, parental education level, and socioeconomic status. Intervention Interventions included early intensive behavioral intervention without (EIBI) and with (Parent training) large parent training components. Approaches ranged in terms of manualization, techniques (e.g., DIR vs. TEACCH), provider, setting (i.e., school vs. home; individual vs. group), frequency, and intensity. 14/25 studies provided at least 6 months of treatment and 11/25 provided at least a year. Comparators Comparators included eclectic interventions, “treatment as usual” in the community, lower levels of manualized treatments, providing manuals with no additional training/support, special education preschool curricula, DVD-based parent training, and parent support. As in the intervention groups, comparators varied by setting, provider, frequency, and intensity, all of which were inconsistently documented. Outcomes Studies commonly assessed IQ, language, autism severity, and adaptive behavior outcomes after anywhere from 2 weeks to 2 years of intervention. Many studies found that both groups improved in IQ, adaptive behavior, and language/communication skills. Others found differential treatment effects. Because most studies compared one treatment to another without controlling for frequency or intensity, it is not always clear whether improvement is due to receiving any treatment
