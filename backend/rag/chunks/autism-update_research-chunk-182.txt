Evidence table, continued Study Description Intervention Inclusion/ Exclusion Criteria/ Population Baseline Measures Outcomes Author: Strauss et al. 2012 55 Country: Italy Intervention setting: clinic and home Enrollment period: NR Funding: NR Design: Prospective Cohort Note see related study, Fava 2011 56 Intervention: EIBI – cross-setting, staff and parent mediated. For 12 months, alternated between one week of 25 hours of therapist-led center-based intervention and 3 weeks of an average of 14 hrs/week parent-led home intervention. Comparison (eclectic): parents not actively seeking parental involvement; approximately 12 hours per week of in-home developmental intervention and cognitive behavioral treatment without active parental inclusion in therapy sessions. ** Group assignments not random. Parents were able to choose which group their children were assigned to.
