as the ADI [ Autism Diagnostic Interview (Le Couteur, Rutter, Lord, & Rios, 1989), ADI-Revised (ADI-R; Lord, Rutter, & Le Couteur, 1994)] and ADOS [ Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (Lord, Rutter, Goode, & Heemsbergen, 1989), Pre-Linguistic ADOS (PL-ADOS; DiLavore, Lord, & Rutter, 1995), ADOS-Generic (ADOS-G; Lord et al., 2000)]. Standardization samples for ASD instruments consist of predominately males, with a sex ratio of approximately 3:1 (Koenig & Tsatsanis, 2005). For disorders such as ASD with such a pronounced gender difference, Rutter, Caspi, and Moffitt (2003) noted that there is a paucity of research addressing the validity of diagnostic criteria by gender. In addition, symptom criteria or assessment items may be biased in that they are more typical of one gender, raising the issue of whether separate criteria content or requirements or different norms or cutoff scores based on gender are appropriate (Bell, Foster, & Mash, 2005; Rutter et al., 2003). Therefore, during assessment, careful consideration should be given to gender, age, and cognitive/adaptive level, as opposed to only comparing females to typically developing males or males with ASD (Koenig & Tsatsanis, 2005; Matson & Minshawi, 2007). 3. Gender differences in the general population Quite a large literature base exists concerning gender differences in the general population in a multitude of variables (Hyde, 2007). However, this is beyond the scope of this topic. This section will encompass a brief review of the research in gender differences in the general population which have potential implications related to ASD symptoms as discussed by Koenig and Tsatsanis (2005). Nonetheless, it is notable that even in typically developing populations, some research has yielded mixed findings, and some differences are slight rather than meaningful (e.g., Charman, Ruffman, & Clements, 2002; Jarrold, Butler, Cottington, & Jimenez, 2000; Koenig & Tsatsanis, 2005; Wallentin, 2009). The large majority of these variables have not been sufficiently examined in ASD (Koenig & Tsatsanis, 2005). Regarding socialization, Koenig and Tsatsanis (2005) reviewed some evidence to suggest a potential female advantage in decoding facial expressions and nonverbal cues, empathizing, and theory of mind (e.g., Bacon, Fein, Morris, Waterhouse, & Allen, 1998; Brown & Dunn, 1996; McClure, 2000; Nyde ´ n, Hjelmquist, & Gillberg, 2000). If so, Koenig and Tsatsanis (2005) hypothesized that females with ASD could either appear less or more impaired, compared to males with ASD or typically developing females, respectively. Koenig and Tsatsanis (2005) pointed out that gender differences in the number of peers, types of activities, and social roles in peer groups could pose differing social demands (e.g., McLennan, Lord, & Schopler, 1993). With regard to communication, females show a slight advantage in early language development, though this does not persist, and other purported gender differences have been frequently cited but are not supported in the research base (Wallentin, 2009). However, Koenig and Tsatsanis (2005) emphasized some aspects of language with social implications. For example, Koenig and Tsatsanis (2005) reviewed evidence suggesting females build relationships by sharing thoughts and emotions requiring more social communication skills, while males build relationships on
