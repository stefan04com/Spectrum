or high quality in five previously published meta-analyses (Eldevik 2009, Makrygianni 2010, Peters-Scheffer 2011, Reichow 2009, Spreckley 2009). 198 The 15 studies included 263 children with ASD. The sequential meta-analysis found a medium treatment benefit for early intervention vs. comparison interventions for the outcomes of intellectual functioning, language, and adaptive 96 behavior. The magnitude of treatment benefit varied for outcomes when assessing pre- to post- differences in the early intervention group. For IQ, the standardized mean difference effect size for group differences was 0.61 (p<.001) and the pre to post differences in the early intervention group was 0.71 (p<.01). Between group effect sizes for adaptive behavior and language were also considered medium (0.60 and 0.72, respectively, p values <.001). Pre to post effect sizes for adaptive behavior (0.35, p=ns) and language (0.69, p<.05) did not reach sufficiency and could not be considered as providing evidence of medium pre to post treatment benefit. The authors note that meta-analyses for pre to post differences in adaptive behavior and language were underpowered. An overview of four of the same meta-analyses noted above plus one additional (Virues- Ortega 2010) described methodologic limitations across the meta-analyses. 199 Limitations included small sample sizes in included studies, inclusion of nonrandomized studies, lack of standardized control groups, errors in interpretation of studies, and variations in the early intervention approaches assessed. Four of the five meta-analyses concluded that early intervention was an effective approach. For IQ, the weighted mean effect size across meta- analyses ranged from 0.38 to 1.19 and from 0.30 to 1.09 for adaptive behavior. Despite the need for additional research, particularly in understanding effective treatment component and child characteristics associated with optimal outcomes, the authors conclude that early intervention can produce significant effects on IQ and adaptive behavior for many young children with ASD.
