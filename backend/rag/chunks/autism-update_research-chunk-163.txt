Parents of children in combined group received an average of 11.4 PT sessions. Assessments: Home Situations Questionnaire (HSQ), Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability (ABC- I), Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS), Noncompliance index. Assessed weekly for 8 weeks then every 4 weeks until week 24.
