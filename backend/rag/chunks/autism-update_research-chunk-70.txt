for the treatment group compared with control. While both groups improved over time, Mullen receptive language and Vineland communication scores were significantly better in the treatment vs. control arm (p values <.05). Effect sizes for differences at the 4-week followup were 0.59 (Vineland) and 0.34 (Mullen); scores for the 8-week followup were not reported. Studies Addressing Pretend Play One poor quality nonrandomized, crossover study conducted in a private preschool included 12 high functioning children with ASD (age range 55-75 months). 161 Intervention group participants received the Picture Me Playing intervention, which included scripted stories built around specific toys to model and encourage pretend play. Instances of play dialogue increased significantly following intervention for the treatment group compared with control (3.6 times more utterances over baseline vs. 1.79 times, p<.05), though frequency of play utterances in both groups improved from baseline. Gains in pretend play for both groups also generalized to a toy not used in the intervention and without scripted utterances. Studies Addressing Imitation A good quality pilot RCT of Reciprocal Imitation Training, which uses naturalistic approaches to promote imitation and social interaction, allocated 27 children to either Reciprocal Imitation Training (n=14, mean age=39.3±7.3 months, mental age=20.8±6.6) for 3 hours/week for 10 weeks or control/treatment as usual (n=13, mean age=36.5±8.00, mental age=17.9±7.5). 152 , 153 The interventionist-led imitation training included modeling of play and gestures and contingent imitation of children’s responses and actions with toys. Children in both 52 arms continued to receive between .25 and 25.5 hours of additional intervention per week. Data for 21 of the children was also reported in an earlier pilot, 153 which reported gains in imitation for the treatment group compared with control (p<.05). Gains in imitation were associated with the number of spontaneous play acts at baseline. In the followup RCT, 152 the intervention group made more joint attention initiations compared with control (p<.05). Intervention participants also improved on the Social-Emotional Scale compared with the control arm (p=.02). Changes in imitation were not shown to be associated with gains in social functioning. Studies Addressing Parent/Child Communication In a fair quality randomized trial of a focused play intervention, investigators allocated children to either the play intervention (n=36, mean age=58.3±12.7 months) or a control group (n=34, mean age=55.9±11.9 months). 156 Parents of children in the treatment and the control groups could participate in a parent education program focused on advocacy for their children. Parents in the treatment group also participated in a manualized play time intervention, which used home-based sessions (90 minutes/week for 12 weeks) to promote parental engagement and encouragement of child communication. Children in both groups continued to receive a mean of 14 hours (± 5-8 hours) of school programming and individual services such as ABA-based approaches for a mean of 12±10 to 12 hours/week during the treatment phase. Children also received a mean of >12 hours of school or individual services during the 12-month followup period. In analyses at the end of intervention, maternal synchronization (maternal direction of child attention or utterances
