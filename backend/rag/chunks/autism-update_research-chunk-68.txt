at followup. Ability to use spoken language at followup (“passing” the language assessments) was predicted by children’s average play level at baseline (p<.01). Number of functional play types at baseline predicted greater cognitive skills. Age at baseline, initiation of joint attention, play level and treatment group assignment predicted subsequent vocabulary ability (all p<.03); these factors together explained 64 percent of spoken language variability. 50 In a fair quality RCT of a joint attention intervention adapted from this study 140 , 141 , 148 , 149 investigators randomized 38 caregiver/child dyads to either immediate, parent-mediated treatment (n=19) or a wait list control group (n=19). 150 The 8-week treatment included individualized, developmentally appropriate play routines to promote parents’ following of their children’s interests and activities. Children in both groups ranged in age from 21 to 36 months (mean=30.82 months, mean mental age=19.2 months). At the end of intervention, children in the treatment group demonstrated less object-focused play, more responsiveness to joint attention, more functional play acts, and more joint engagement than children in the control group (p<.05). Groups did not differ in initiations of joint attention, diversity of symbolic play, or unengaged actions. At followup of the treatment group 12 months after the end of intervention, results suggested maintenance of gains in joint engagement, response to joint attention, and reduction of object engagement, but changes in scores were not significant. Types of functional play acts improved in the treatment group at the 12-month followup (p<.01). In analyses of potential predictors of outcome, greater caregiver quality of involvement (rated by investigators) predicted increased joint engagement (p<.05) but not other play skills or engagement outcomes. Parent- rated adherence or competence did not predict changes in any outcome. Number of hours of other intervention similarly did not predict any outcomes. A fair quality RCT of a classroom-based joint attention or symbolic play intervention based on the manualized approaches in other studies reported above 140 , 141 randomized 14 special education teachers to either a symbolic play followed by a joint attention intervention (n=10 children, mean age=54.50±5.06 months, mean mental age=25.29±15.77 months), the joint attention intervention followed by symbolic play (n children=14, mean age=56.21±10.42, mean mental age=36.25±11 months), or a waitlist control (n children=9, mean age=59.67±10.61, mean mental age=30.38±13.19). 158 Treatment occurred in eight weekly sessions over 8 weeks (4 weeks on either joint attention or symbolic play followed by 4 weeks on the other approach), groups did not differ on play or joint attention behaviors in classroom observations at followup. Children randomized to either treatment arm spent more time in a joint engagement state compared with the control arm (effect size=0.63). In analyses combining the treatment groups, joint engagement time, joint attention responses/minute, joint attention initiations/minute, symbolic play acts/minute, all assessed via classroom observations, increased significantly from baseline to post-intervention (effect sizes of 0.41, 0.43, 0.21, and 0.51 respectively). In investigator- mediated rating of early social communication, the number of joint attention responses increased from baseline (effect size=0.23); children were able to generalize increases in
