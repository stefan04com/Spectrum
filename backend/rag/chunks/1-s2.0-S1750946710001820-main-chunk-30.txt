2004; Loat et al., 2008). Some evidence has been found in support of the X-inactivation/X-linkage hypothesis. Loat et al. (2004) found stronger correlations in MZ male compared to female twins for prosocial behavior at 2 years, verbal ability at 3 years, and peer problems at 4 years of age. Regarding DZ twins, female twins were more similar in the areas of prosocial behavior and verbal ability at 3 years (Loat et al., 2004). Further, Loat et al. (2008) found evidence for the same pattern for teacher reported prosocial and problem behavior at 7 years, and parent reported social impairments (CAST) at 8 years. Female MZ twins were less similar in hyperactivity and problem behavior, while female DZ twins were more similar on the CAST composite and communication and non-social domains (Loat et al., 2008). Trends of less similarity in MZ female twins were found in the areas of peer problems, academic achievement, language achievement, and nonverbal IQ (Loat et al., 2008). In a primarily general population sample, Ronald et al. (2006) found significantly higher MZ twin correlations for social impairments and overall ASD symptoms in males, while female MZ twin correlations were significantly higher in the area of restricted, repetitive behaviors and interests (CAST). In an ASD population, Mazefsky et al. (2008) found a trend towards higher correlations for both MZ and DZ twins in males on nonverbal communication and social dysfunction (ADI-R). 5.6.3. X-linked male extremes In the general population, males exhibit greater variance than females for many traits (e.g., IQ) and thus are overrepresented at the extremes of distributions (e.g., Hedges & Nowell, 1995; Johnson, Carothers, & Deary, 2008; Lehre, Lehre, Laake, & Danbolt, 2009). The X-chromosome contains a high density of genes important for brain development and reproduction, and ID is approximately three times more often related to genes on the X versus autosomes (Zechner et al., 2001). These genes for IQ on the X may have evolved due to selection in males by females (Zechner et al., 2001). Regarding extremes, in females, X-linked gene expression is averaged out across cells via X-inactivation (Craig et al., 2004; Lehre et al., 2009). In contrast, males exhibit extreme X-linked phenotypes, due to impact of X-linked genes without a Y homologue (Craig et al., 2004; Skuse, 2005, 2006; Zechner et al., 2001). Skuse (2005, 2006) described how males are more impacted by these X-linked traits (e.g., intelligence, social cognition, emotion regulation), resulting in more exceptional abilities in some areas, but more mental impairments due to mutations. Some researchers have examined gender differences in variability in ASD traits. As discussed earlier, across the lifespan in the general population, males exhibit greater autistic traits. In addition, studies have found gender distinct distributions, as well as larger standard deviations in males (Auyeung et al., 2008; Baron-Cohen et al., 2001; Constantino & Todd, 2003; Posserud et al., 2006; Williams et al., 2008). In contrast, in twins 2–4 years, Loat et al. (2004) found similar gender variances for traits (i.e., anxiety, prosocial behavior, hyperactivity, conduct
