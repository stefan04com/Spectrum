Duration of intervention ranged from 3 to 12 weeks. Detailed Analysis One fair quality RCT compared CBT alone, melatonin alone, CBT plus melatonin, and placebo in 160 children with ASD between the ages of 4 and 10 years. 189 CBT consisted of four 50-minute sessions focused on recognizing dysfunctional attitudes about sleep, parent- management of children’s sleep, and replacing poor sleep habits with appropriate behavior. Participants received 3 mg controlled release melatonin administered at the same time each day. Investigators allocated 40 participants to each group; mean age across groups ranged from 6.3 to 7.1 years, and each group lost 5 to 8 participants over the 12-week intervention due to withdrawals or missing actigraphy data. All active treatment groups improved in most measures of sleep quality compared with the control group (p<.01). In general, the combination group improved more than the others, followed by the melatonin alone and CBT alone groups. Scores for children who received melatonin alone improved on bedtime resistance, sleep onset delay, sleep duration, and night waking compared with the CBT group (p<.001). Effect sizes (exact data not reported) ranged from medium to high. Sleep onset latency (time to fall asleep) and sleep efficiency (ratio of total sleep time to total time in bed) were reduced
