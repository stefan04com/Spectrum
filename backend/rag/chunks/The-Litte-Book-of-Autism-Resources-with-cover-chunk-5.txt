As a parent with a child diagnosed with Autistic Spectrum Disorder you will be looking for answers to a thousand questions. The original Train resource book was published in 2003, when finding information was much more difficult that it is today. With the growth of the internet, the amount of information available can actually be just as frustrating as not having enough information. With that in mind, we thought it was time to update and re-publish the book. There are quite a few resources available in McLean County, the state, and nationally for people who live and work with individuals with autism. We are hopeful that this book will help you find the ones you need as you need them. If your journey is just beginning, you may be overwhelmed with the number of questions you have and what is the right thing to do for your child. Take the time to explore each therapy and service. Talk to other parents about their experiences. We have a strong community of parents who have kids with autism and they are usually more than happy to share information and help whenever they can. The book is intended to provide you with information to access many of the programs available. It is not meant to be a recommendation for any form of therapy. I have intentionally left out most of the alternative therapy options, as those are a very personal choice. The only intervention that I totally advocate for is early, intensive educational programming individualized to meet your child’s needs. I strongly suggest that you learn all you can when it comes to the special education process, disability laws, and your districts placement
