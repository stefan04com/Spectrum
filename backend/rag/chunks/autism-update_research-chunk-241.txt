study correct for multiple testing? + = yes - = no NA 1d. For observational studies, were potential confounders and effect measure modifiers captured? + = yes - = no NA Considerations: Were the groups well categorized at baseline? Were baseline differences assessed? 1e. For observational studies, were potential confounders and effect measure modifiers handled appropriately? + = appropriate analysis - = inappropriate analysis NA Considerations: Confounders are variables that are associated both with the intervention and the outcome and that change the relationship of the intervention to the outcome. These are variables that we would control for in analysis. D-15 Effect measure modifiers are variables that we think of as stratifying, in that the relationship between the intervention and outcome is fundamentally different in different strata of the effect modifier. Observational research should include an assessment of potential confounders and modifiers, and if they are observed, analysis should control for or stratify on them. Was the candidate variable selection discussed/noted? Was the model-building approach described? Were any variables unrelated to the studied variables that could have altered the outcome handled appropriately? Were any variables not under study that affected the causal factors handled appropriately? D-16 Appendix E.
