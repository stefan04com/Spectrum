accessibility are pertinent but largely understudied. Our understanding of treatment impact and implementation would be greatly enhanced by research that explicitly evaluates which treatments have the greatest real-world impact. Similarly, evaluations of interventions delivered by community providers are important for comparing effects of such approaches with those of interventions delivered in controlled research environments. Such evaluations are complicated by the complexity of community systems and methodologic challenges, including creating similar treatment and control groups and maintaining fidelity. However, they will be increasingly valuable for scaling intervention for ASD. Also important in addressing this gap is improving our currently limited understanding of the effects of provider training and provider characteristics on outcomes of treatment. Finally, this literature lacks studies that directly compare interventions or employ combinations of interventions (e.g., comparing medical interventions with behavioral interventions, with educational interventions, or with allied health interventions), despite the fact that most children receive multiple concurrent treatments. Conclusions In sum, a growing evidence base suggests that behavioral interventions are associated with positive outcomes for some children with ASD. Despite improvements in the quality of the included literature, a need remains for studies of interventions across settings and continued improvements in methodologic rigor. Substantial scientific advances are needed to enhance our understanding of which interventions are most effective for specific children with ASD and to isolate the elements or components of interventions most associated with effects.
