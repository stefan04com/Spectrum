findings based on the favorability of direction or magnitude of effect. a Excerpted from Berkman et al. 2013 56 Applicability Finally, it is important to consider the ability of the outcomes observed to apply both to other populations and to other settings (especially for those therapies that take place within a clinical/treatment setting but are hoped to change behavior overall). Our assessment of applicability included determining the population, intervention, comparator, and setting in each study and developing an overview of these elements for each intervention category. Peer Review and Public Commentary Researchers and clinicians with expertise in behavioral, medical, social, psychological and educational issues and individuals representing stakeholder and user communities provided external peer review of this report; AHRQ and an associate editor also provided comments. The draft report was posted on the AHRQ Web site for 4 weeks to elicit public comment. We addressed all reviewer comments, revised the text as appropriate, and documented changes and revisions to the report in a disposition of comments report that will be made available 3 months after AHRQ posts the final review on the AHRQ Web site. 16 Results Results of Literature Searches and Description of Included Studies Article Selection We identified 2,639 citations and abstracts (Figure 2). We excluded 2,012 studies at abstract review and assessed the full text of 627 studies. Among these, 79 publications, comprising 65 unique studies, met our criteria. Eight of these studies report followup data to papers included in the 2011 review of therapies for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The 65 included studies comprise 48 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 17 nonrandomized trials or cohort studies. Table 5 outlines study characteristics. Appendix E includes a list of all studies excluded at the abstract and full-text review stages. Figure 2.
