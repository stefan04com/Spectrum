in line with toys/actions in which child was already engaged vs. redirecting or not synchronized with child’s actions) was significantly greater in the treatment group compared with control (effect size=0.08, p<.05). Maternal synchronization was moderated by baseline maternal insightfulness (p<.05) and synchronization was greater in those mothers rated as insightful compared with non-insightful (effect size=0.31, p<.05). Expressive language scores did not differ between groups at the end of intervention or at followup 12 months post- intervention (effect size for baseline to followup change=0.03, p=ns). Children with baseline expressive language abilities below 11.3 months showed greater gains in language in the intervention group vs. control (effect size=0.25 for 24 children with low language skills). The link between short-term gain in maternal synchronization and long-term language (12 months post-treatment) gains was not moderated by maternal insightfulness, nor did initial language skills moderate the link between gains in maternal synchronization after 12 weeks and long term gains in expressive language. 156 Another fair quality RCT included 14 participants (age range 28 to 68 months, mean 41.14) randomized to either an adapted More Than Words curriculum focused on teaching parents to understand child communication and promote verbal responsiveness or to a waiting list. 154 Treatment group parents received approximately 12 hours of training and 14 small-group parent- child coaching sessions. Overall, children had mean auditory language age of 14.79 months and expressive age of 20.21 months with greater baseline language abilities in the waitlist group compared with the treatment group. At followup, treatment group parents improved significantly compared with the control group in measures of verbal engagement with their children (p values ≤.03). Children in the treatment group increased in prompted communication acts compared with control (p<.03), but spontaneous verbal and nonverbal communication acts did not differ between groups. 53 Table 9. Summary of outcomes of studies of play/interaction-based interventions Author, Year, Country Groups, N Enrollment/N Final Study Quality Age, Mean Months±SD IQ, Mean±SD Key Outcomes Joint attention studies Goods et al. 2013 151 US G1: Joint attention intervention, 8/6 G2: Control, 7/5 Quality: Good G1: 48.73±11.68 G2: 54.68±10.25 G1: 37.70±15.21 G2: 26.67±10.12 • Joint attention intervention delivered by preschool teachers; G1 demonstrated more spontaneous play types, spent less time unengaged in classroom, and initiated more requesting gestures than G2 (effect sizes 0.81, 1.63, 1.51 respectively, p values≤.05) • No significant group differences on the Early Social Communication Scales measures of joint attention Kasari et al. 2010 150 US G1: Immediate joint attention intervention, 19/19 G2: Waitlist control, 19/19 Quality: Good G1: 30.35±0.93 G2: 31.31±0.90 G1: 64.80±5.35 G2: 59.81±3.14 • Joint attention intervention implemented by caregivers. Children in G1 exhibited significantly less object-focused play, responsiveness to joint attention, functional play types, and greater joint engagement than G2 at initial followup (p<.05); gains in joint engagement, responsiveness to joint attention, and types of functional play were maintained at 1-year followup of G1 • Groups did not differ on other/unengaged play time at followup. G1 did not show greater joint attention initiations or diversity of symbolic
