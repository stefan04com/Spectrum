or restricted range of interests (may or may not be unusual topics) - Challenges focusing or engaging in tasks or conversations that are not related to strong interests - Difficulty transitioning away from thoughts, activities, or actions involving their interests Example Question: Does the student have any unusual or special interests or preoccupations? Preoccupation with Parts of Objects, such as: - Plays or interacts with objects or toys by spinning, twirling, or banging them rather than using them in intended ways - Focusing on how an object works rather than its function - Looking closely at objects from different angles (i.e., visual inspection) Example Question: Does the student play with the whole toy or do they seem more interested in a certain part (such as spinning the wheels of a car rather than driving on the ground)? Unusual or Inconsistent Responsiveness to Sensory Input, including: - An under- or -overreaction to scents, light, touch, temperature, textures, or tastes - Reaction to sensory input may vary depending on the students’ interests or degree of control (for example, a student may become overwhelmed in the cafeteria when it is very loud but may prefer to listen to favorite music at a high volume) - Under responsiveness to pain, heat, or cold - Excessive smelling, touching, or licking objects - Fascination with lights or spinning objects Example Questions: Does the student seem overly sensitive to noises, smells, touch, food, lights, etc.? How does the student react to pain or discomfort? Does the student examine objects by smelling, touching, or licking them? 30 Cognitive/Intellectual Domain Measuring a student’s cognitive and intellectual abilities provides important information on possible co-occurring intellectual developmental disabilities as well as alternative explanations for a student’s difficulties. This information is also valuable for informing relevant academic and learning supports based on a child’s unique cognitive profile of strengths and weaknesses. Recommended Assessment Sources  Standardized Assessment (Compare results with parent report and achievement in the classroom) Important considerations when choosing and interpreting an appropriate cognitive/intellectual measure: • IQ scores can be unstable for children with autism, particularly in early childhood (Leboyer, 2015) • There is not a single pattern of cognitive abilities that is indicative of autism • Social and communication impairments for students with autism may make it more challenging to respond to verbal test items or understand instructions • Tests that allow for the separation of verbal and nonverbal estimates of ability are preferred • Consider the student’s expressive and receptive language abilities, and native language • Consider the student’s ability to follow along in adult-led structured activities • Assess the degree to which results reflect the student’s autism characteristics rather than underlying abilities. For example, some students may have challenges with joint attention, which may impact their ability to focus on and respond to material that is not related to their interests. Some students with autism will benefit from additional behavioral strategies and supports to increase their engagement and participation in standardized cognitive testing. Below are several possible
