Intervention Intensity, Duration, And Focus Key Outcomes • Severity ratings (CARS, ADOS) decreased significantly over time for G1 but not G2; effect size for change in ADOS=1.51, CARS=1.50) • Differences between groups in measures of emotional and behavioral problems and behavioral flexibility were not significant • More G1 participants achieved clinical and reliable significant on developmental age, adaptive behavior, interpersonal relationships, play and leisure time, receptive and expressive language, ASD severity, and responding to social interaction vs. G2 • More G2 vs. G1 participants obtained clinical and reliable significance on measures of problem behavior and maternal stress; equal numbers of G1 and G2 participants obtained clinical and reliable significance on IQ, behavioral flexibility, joint attention, behavioral requests, and initiating social interaction • Diagnoses changes from autism to PDD- NOS in 45% of G1 and 20% of G2; 10% in G1 classified as non-autistic at 24 months (0 in G2); level of intellectual disability declined in 55% of G1 and 5% of G2 • Baseline hours of treatment, developmental age, IQ, level of adaptive behavior, play skills , receptive language significant predictors of progress Dawson et al. 2012 22 , 23 US G1:
