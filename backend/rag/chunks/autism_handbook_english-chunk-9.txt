Autism Funding: Ages 6 - 18 The primary intent of Autism Funding: Ages 6 - 18 is to assist families with the cost of purchasing eligible out-of- school autism intervention that will promote their child’s communication, social-emotional, academic and functional life skills development. Families of children aged 6 to 18 with a diagnosis of ASD can receive up to $6,000 per year towards eligible intervention services that are outside of the child’s school or educational program (please see Best Practices on page 23). Up to 20 per cent of the annual funding may be used to purchase training, travel and equipment related to autism intervention.
