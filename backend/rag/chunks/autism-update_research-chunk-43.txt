to social interaction vs. G2 • More G2 vs. G1 participants obtained clinical and reliable significance on measures of problem behavior and maternal stress; equal numbers of G1 and G2 participants obtained clinical and reliable significance on IQ, behavioral flexibility, joint attention, behavioral requests, and initiating social interaction • Diagnoses changes from autism to PDD-NOS in 45% of G1 and 20% of G2; 10% in G1 classified as non-autistic at 24 months (0 in G2); level of intellectual disability declined in 55% of G1 and 5% of G2 • Baseline hours of treatment, developmental age, IQ, level of adaptive behavior, play skills , receptive language significant predictors of progress 24 Table 6.

G1 improved on parent -rated reciprocal social interaction (p<.05) • No significant differences among groups on any measure at followup • Children with higher Mullen scores made fewer gains in G1; children with high Preschool Language Scale scores at baseline had higher communication and ASD characteristics and severity composite scores in G1 • Females in G2 had smaller communication gains, although few females in study overall (n=33) 25 Table 6.
