1 www.ohsudoernbecher.com Autism Spectrum Disorder Handbook We greatly value the opportunity to meet with you and to help you better understand Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This book was written with the help of families as an ongoing resource to answer questions you may have now or in the future. We have included a lot of information on a variety of topics in hopes that you will be able to find some of the information you need to get started. If you have specific questions about the reports you receive from the Autism Clinic at OHSU Doernbecher’s Child Development and Rehabilitation Center (CDRC), please write them down and call any of the clinicians who worked with you. Their names and phone numbers are listed on the written reports you will receive. Please think of us as an ongoing resource for you to provide information, to answer questions, or help you find the supports you need. Tips for using this booklet: 1. Don’t feel like you have to read it all at once. 2. Read what is important to you now and save the rest. 3. Know that your experience and needs may differ from those shared here. 4. Keep your notes and other paperwork in a set place, like a file, so that you can take it with you to your future appointments. Thank you again for trusting us with your care.
