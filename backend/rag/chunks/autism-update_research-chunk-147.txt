Following 8 weeks of one 2-hour parent education session per week and two 2-hour/week home sessions. Children received average of 247 hours of treatment during the study (range 181-263) Assessments: observed, parent report Groups: G1: PECS G2: PRT Provider: • Undergraduate student therapists trained in PECS and PRT.
