Evidence table, continued Study Description Intervention Inclusion/ Exclusion Criteria/ Population Baseline Measures Outcomes Author: Malow et al. 2014 6 Country: US Intervention setting: Home Enrollment period: NR Funding: UDSHHS, HRSA, Maternal and Child Health Research Program; research was conducted as part of Autism Speaks Autism Treatment Network. Design: RCT Intervention: Sleep education curriculum for parents. Parents in the group program received two 2- hour sessions conducted 1 week apart and parents in the individual received one 1-hour session with two follow-up phone calls. Assessments: observed, parent report (Actigraphy and parent questionnaires) collected at baseline and 1 month after treatment Groups: G1: individual sleep education G2: group sleep education Provider: • Trained educators Treatment manual followed: Yes Defined protocol followed: Yes Measure of treatment fidelity reported: Yes Co-interventions held Inclusion criteria: age 2-10 years diagnosis of ASD based on interview conducted by psychologist or developmental pediatrician with expertise in ASD that incorporated DSM-IV- TR criteria and confirmation by ADOS Sleep onset latency of at least 30 minutes on three out of 7 nights/week based on parent report and confirmed by 14 scorable days of actigraphy. Children with other sleep difficulties identified as problems by parents Medication free or on stable dose of medication
