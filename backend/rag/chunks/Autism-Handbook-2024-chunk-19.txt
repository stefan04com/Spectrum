supports that may be beneficial. It is important to document what supports were used and to what extent they impacted the validity of scores. • Prepare the student for what to expect during the testing process in advance Examples: test within the student’s schedule and allow them to visit the testing room in advance • Choose a quiet environment with few distractions • Utilize supports that the student may be already benefit from in the classroom Examples: visual reminders to stay seated, frequent breaks, work systems 31 • For some students with autism, they may benefit from a First – Then format Example: allow the student to alternate between a non-preferred task (testing items) and a preferred task (time to play with cars or talk about a favorite subject) • Create a visual schedule or checklist to show progress • Use rewards and incentives to increase motivation (contingent on participation, not accuracy of responses) • Consider the order of testing items in advance to best keep the child’s engagement and create momentum Adaptive Behavior Domain Adaptive behavior assessment considers how a student is functioning independently with daily living skills, communication skills, and social skills compared to age-expectations. Many students with autism display delays in social and communication skills as well as daily living skills. Recommended Assessment Sources  Parent and Teacher Report  Norm-referenced Scales An assessment of adaptive behavior is an essential part of an autism evaluation: • Discrepancies between adaptive functioning and intellectual ability can help inform strategies for intervention and support planning as well as identify adaptive strengths. • It’s also important to keep in mind that discrepancies between adaptive and cognitive functioning may be greater in individuals with higher cognitive abilities. • In some cases, information regarding adaptive functioning is also a vital part of determining eligibility for disability benefits and evaluating a students’ capability to live or work independently. Adverse Education Impact When Determining Eligibility Determining if a disability adversely impacts a student’s education is an essential part of educational eligibility determination. For a student identified as having autism, it is important to consider skills or activities that may not be considered academic but may be related to a student’s educational performance. When evaluating the presence of an adverse impact, a school team should consider a child’s performance and functioning across the following areas: • Functional/daily life skills • Social adaptation 32 • Communication • Behavior • Emotional development • Academic/educational performance Common considerations for possible adverse effect for students with autism may impact lifelong outcomes, such as employment and living independently. These may include a student’s ability to: • Transfer and generalize new skills across different settings • Work effectively in group activities • Communicate effectively using verbal and nonverbal communication • Remain on-task and/or complete work • Follow social norms/expectations • Form and maintain relationships • Be independent in daily life • Problem solve • Access instruction and peer interaction Note: Determining adverse impact should be made on a case-by-case basis and take
