Some families are relieved to hear about a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and others need some time to accept the diagnosis. No matter what you feel today, at some point you will be thinking: “What do I do now?” Finding out what resources are available and coming up with a plan to help you and your child be successful is a great place to start. What Do I Do Now? 7 www.ohsudoernbecher.com We have provided (below) a list of things that you can do to get started. Many of them are also listed on the recommendations you were given in the OHSU Autism Clinic.  Schedule an appointment with your primary care doctor. • Bring a copy of the reports you were given after your evaluation with us. Your referring provider should also be receiving the results from Doernbecher. • Discuss the information you were given and get any referrals for therapies or follow-up appointments if needed. • Make sure your doctor is comfortable and knowledgeable regarding ASD.  Contact your local Education Service District (ESD) if your child is under 5 years old. • Begin an Early Intervention (EI) program if your child is not already participating in one. These programs are usually free in Oregon and Washington.  If your child is school-aged, share the information with the teacher or school special education team. • Sharing information and coming up with a plan together is helpful for the school, the parents and most of all, the child. Your child may need to have an Individual Education Program (IEP) developed or an existing program changed to support his or her success.  Talk to another parent of a child with ASD. • The Autism Society of Oregon (ASO) can connect you with other families in your area. OHSU and ASO also collaborate on the Welcome Project
