limitations: Medium Consistency: Consistent Directness: Direct Precision: Imprecise Reporting bias: Undetected Other concerns: Children in several studies were also receiving other early intervention; disentangling results is difficult. Expressive, but not receptive, language skills generally increased in the treatment arms in 2 studies; prompted, but not spontaneous, communication improved in 1 study. Social skills Low for positive effect RCT: 1 good, 3 fair (173) Study limitations: Medium Consistency: Consistent Directness: Indirect Precision: Precise Reporting bias: Undetected Other concerns: Children in several studies were also receiving other early intervention; disentangling results is difficult. Joint engagement or positive affect improved in treatment arms in 3 studies. ES-15 Table B. Strength of the evidence (SOE) (continued) Intervention Outcome SOE Study Design Quality (N participants) Ratings for Domains Used to Assess SOE, and Issues Key Findings Interventions addressing commonly associated conditions: CBT Anxiety High (for positive effect in older children with at least average IQs) RCT: 6 good, 1 fair, 2 poor (413) nRCT: 1 fair (31) Study limitations: Low Consistency: Consistent Directness: Direct Precision: Precise Reporting bias: Undetected Other concerns: Studies included older children, typically with IQ >70. Improvement in anxiety symptoms was greater for CBT vs. control group in 5/6 studies; study that did not show improvement compared CBT with an active treatment instead of a wait-listed control. Improvements were maintained at followup. Symptom severity Low for positive effect RCT: 2 good (81) Study limitations: Low Consistency: Consistent Directness: Direct Precision: Imprecise Reporting bias: Undetected Other concerns: None There was significant improvement in clinician- and parent-rated measures of anxiety severity in both studies, with improvement maintained at followup. SOE is low based on only 2 small studies. ABA = applied behavior analysis; CBT = cognitive behavioral therapy; nRCT = nonrandomized controlled trial; RCT = randomized controlled trial; SOE = strength of evidence ES-16 Applicability Studies of early intensive behavioral and developmental interventions were conducted primarily in preschool-age and early school-age children (i.e., typically children initially ages 1.5–7 years). The cognitive, language, and adaptive behavior profiles of participants included in these studies were generally in line with those seen in the community (i.e., typically marked by substantial impairment/delay, but with some children with more intact early cognitive/language profiles). Often studies were conducted in highly controlled environments (e.g., university-supported intervention trials) or the methodology was not well described (i.e., nonmanualized approaches), which substantially limits their applicability to community-based settings. Even available manualized interventions require high degrees of specialization and training that make them difficult to implement in community practices. Studies of parent training interventions and play-based interventions for preschool children often emphasized principles of ABA, in accordance with current practice recommendations for the target populations typically referred for these services. Training programs included components to improve social communication skills such as joint attention, play-based interactions, and pragmatic language approaches; interventions were conducted for approximately 1–4 hours/week, with parents trained in how to generalize these skills to other natural settings. Several programs offer manualized intervention protocols that can facilitate their use in community settings. Again, however,
