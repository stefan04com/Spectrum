be directly observed (e.g., stacking blocks or rolling a toy car)—or (b) the underlining cognitive processes and constructs assumed necessary for a specific form of play, which are not readily observable. The latter, for example, is evident in definitions of pretend play that emphasize the symbolic representation and pretense Typical Social and Play Development 4 Table 1.1 Social and play skills observed in typical development Birth–2 months Tends to look toward faces Imitates some facial expressions Orientates or looks toward the sound of voices 2–4 months Smiles and makes eye contact at short distances Plays with their own feet and hands by wiggling, rubbing, and grabbing 4–6 months Imitates a wider range of facial expressions Recognizes familiar people at a distance Coos, babbles, and begins to imitate the intonation and pace of speech Seeks out affection (e.g., raises arms in an effort to be picked up and snuggled) Reaches for and grasps toys (e.g., batting at a hanging mobile) Can hold and shake toys (e.g., make noise with a rattle) 6–9 months Distinguishes between familiar people and strangers (e.g., behaves differently with mom than unknown person) Plays with a variety of toys but has favorite toys Responds to voices by making sounds Uses gestures to communicate (e.g., reaches hand toward desired object while looking at the adult capable of reaching the object) Plays simple social games (e.g., peek-a-boo) 9–12 months Responds to simple spoken requests (e.g., come here) Joint attention is well established Uses toys in a variety of ways Hands objects to people to initiate play (e.g., brings dad the blanket in an effort to start a round of peek-a-boo) Uses two or more toys together (e.g., banging blocks together) 12–18 months Simple pretend play (e.g., doll drinks from empty cup) Scribbles with crayons Pulls toys on a string 2 years Seeks out and plays near or around but not directly with other children (i.e., parallel play) Points to pictures in books Knows names of familiar people Plays simple make-believe games Stacks blocks and builds block structures Physical activity play involving items (e.g., kicks and throws balls) 3 years Shows affection, concern, and empathy to friends (e.g., kiss another person’s “boo-boo”) Takes turns in games Back-and-forth conversation Completes simple non-interlocking puzzles Pretend play involves multiple toys (dolls and doll houses) and more complex themes 4–5 years Prefers to play with other children Plays board or card games Plans games and activities ahead of time Concerned with whether friends like them 1 More Than Just Fun andfiGames: De nition, Development, andfiIntervention… 5 assumed necessary for a child to imagine that one object is another object (e.g., pretending a broom is a guitar) or that an object has properties it does not actually possess (e.g., pretending a broom can fly). Lifter et al. (2011) astutely point out that both perspectives, whether focused on play topography or the underling cognitive processes (referred to as the behavioral and constructivist paradigms, respectively), have contributed to our understanding of play and to the identification of
