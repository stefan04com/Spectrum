gender differences in genetic and environmental factors underlying the relationship between IQ and autistic traits via twins with ASD. Genetic factors impacting autistic traits were highly similar to those impacting IQ for boys (  0.94) and girls (  0.95). Regarding individual specific environmental factors influencing autistic traits, there was a moderate association to those influencing IQ for boys (  0.29) and girls (  0.59). Thus, no significant gender T.T. Rivet, J.L. Matson / Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders 5 (2011) 957–976 960 differences were found in the genetic and environmental factors influencing autistic traits and IQ, and genetic factors underlying both ASD and IQ were highly similar (Nishiyama et al., 2009). This is consistent with evidence suggesting overlap in genes contributing to ID and ASD (Gupta & State, 2007; Laumonnier et al., 2004; Marshall et al., 2008). Reviewing genetics and ASD, Gupta and State (2007) noted that the majority of findings implicate mutations that could result in cognitive or social impairment, or both. It is important to note that Nishiyama et al. (2009) measured autistic traits as a whole via the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS; Reichler & Schopler, 1971; Schopler, Reichler, DeVellis, & Daly, 1980; Schopler, Reichler, & Renner, 1988). However, based on previous research with different assessment instruments and populations, these authors purported that autistic traits in socialization appear orthogonal to IQ, while communication and repetitive behaviors appear to be moderately related to IQ. Hence, further research into gender differences in IQ and ASD is needed, particularly in light of recent research on the dimensional and fractionable nature of autistic traits (see Happe ´ & Ronald, 2008; Happe ´ , Ronald, & Plomin, 2006; Mandy & Skuse, 2008; Skuse, 2007; Volkmar et al., 2009; Waterhouse, 2008; Yirmiya, 2008). Skuse (2007) put forth a hypothesis about the relationship between gender, IQ, and autistic traits. Skuse (2007) discussed that ASD and autistic traits frequently present in individuals with both idiopathic ID or ID associated with genetic conditions (e.g., Fragile X, tuberous sclerosis; Zafeiriou, Ververi, & Vargiami, 2007). In addition, particularly in genetic studies, strict diagnostic criteria have been employed in an attempt to reduce heterogeneity, yielding samples with mostly moderate to severe ID (Skuse, 2007). Furthermore, Skuse (2007) cited evidence from the general population that autistic traits are continuously distributed (i.e., dimensional not categorical) and, in contrast to studies of samples with ASD, uncorrelated with verbal or nonverbal IQ. Skuse (2007) concluded that despite their association, ASD and ID do not typically have common causes. Rather, the genes that have been implicated in ASD are instead important for developing aspects of cognitive ability needed to compensate for vulnerability to underlying autistic traits (i.e., social-cognitive processing; Skuse, 2007). These autistic traits lead to a clinically identifiable disorder in individuals with low IQ, males, or those with ‘‘independent neurodevelopmental vulnerability owing to a wide range of gene mutations, chromosomal anomalies or environmental insults’’ (Skuse, 2007, p. 387). It may be that ‘‘females are equally at risk, in terms
