identified nine comparative studies addressing interventions targeting conditions/behaviors commonly associated with ASD in the 2011 review. These studies included four RCTs 163-167 and one nonrandomized trial 168 of fair quality and three RCTs 169-171 and one prospective cohort 172 of poor quality. Studies addressed CBT for anger or anxiety or parent training approaches. In addition to these studies, we identified nine new studies (reported in 15 publications); 165-167 , 173-184 two of these nine studies, one evaluating CBT 165 , 166 , 178 and one assessing parent training plus risperidone, 167 , 179-181 , 184 report on populations addressed in studies in the 2011 review. As in the 2011 review, studies address either CBT or parent training modalities (Table 10). Among the studies identified for the current review, eight RCTs evaluated CBT: seven conducted in the United States, 173 , 175-178 , 182 , 183 and one in Singapore. 185 Three studies examined CBT compared with control groups receiving treatment as usual. 173 , 177 , 182 Three studies examined CBT compared with wait listed controls, 165 , 166 , 175 , 176 , 178 one study compared CBT with social recreational therapy, 174 and another with a social skills intervention. 183 Studies included two populations: five studies (reported in multiple publications) included subjects with both ASD and primary anxiety disorder diagnoses, 165 , 166 , 173 , 176-178 , 182 and three studies included subjects with ASD only (subjects may or may not have had a formal diagnosis of primary anxiety disorder or studies did not target anxiety). 174 , 175 , 183 Outcomes measured included improvements in anxiety alone in five studies, 173 , 174 , 176 , 177 , 182 improvements in anxiety and daily living skills in one study; 165 , 166 , 178 improvements in executive function in one study, 183 and improvements in emotion regulation in one study. 175 Subjects ranged in age from 4 to 16 years. Five study interventions were conducted over 16 weeks, 165 , 166 , 173 , 174 , 176-178 one study intervention was conducted over 28 weeks , 183 one over 32 weeks, 182 and one over 9 weeks. 175 We rated six studies as good quality 165 , 166 , 173 , 174 , 176-178 , 183 and two as fair. 175 , 182 We identified one fair quality RCT reported in multiple publications and addressing parent training approaches (also reported in the 2011 review). 167 , 179-181 , 184 The study examined the utility of augmenting risperidone with parent training vs. risperidone alone for treatment of serious behavior problems and irritability. Children had diagnoses of ASD in addition to serious behavior problems as defined by reaching specific cutoff scores on measures of irritability and problem behavior, and ages ranged from 4 to 13 years. Outcomes measured included measures of adaptive behavior in addition to measures of problem behavior and irritability and one observed measure of appropriate behavior.
