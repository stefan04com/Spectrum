sessions, with a target improving communication and Social interaction. Intervention given between baseline and Time 1 for the intervention group and between Time 1 and Time 2 for the control group . The control Group undertook the Intervention starting from Week 5 and received the same 10-session intervention. By Time 2, both groups had completed the intervention, and they were combined* to give a larger sample size for detecting intervention effects Assessments: ADOS, Ritvo-Freeman Real Life Rating Scale, Symbolic Play Test, and Parenting Stress Index. Done at 3 time points (baseline, time 1, time 2).
