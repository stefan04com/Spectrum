girls with low birth weight had a significant fourfold increased risk for ASD and ID, but not for ASD alone. Miles et al. (2005) have classified cases of ‘‘complex autism’’ versus ‘‘essential autism’’ and examined gender differences. Complex cases were classified by having more dysmorphic features and/or microcephaly, and comprised all 11 cases in this study with an identified syndrome (i.e., chromosomal; single gene disorders such as tuberous sclerosis and Sotos; fetal valproate exposure) (Miles et al., 2005). Miles et al. (2005) found a higher sex ratio in essential compared to complex autism (6.5:1 versus 3.2:1). In addition, more individuals with essential autism had a family history of ASD, siblings with ASD, higher IQ, and regression at onset (Miles et al., 2005). Conversely, more individuals with complex autism had seizures and an abnormal EEG and brain MRI (Miles et al., 2005). In an earlier study, Miles and Hillman (2000) found comparable results in that the male to female ratio decreased with physical anomalies and abnormal brain MRIs. Specifically, compared to an overall sex ratio of 4.2:1, the sex ratio was significantly lower for those with both abnormal morphology and brain MRI (2.1:1 versus 23:1), as well as for those with abnormal morphology alone (1.7:1 versus 7.5:1) (Miles & Hillman, 2000). Six cases (1 female) in this study had genetic syndromes (i.e., ring chromosome 8, del 8q22, der 15, Sotos, tuberous sclerosis) (Miles & Hillman, 2000). In a population-based study in Atlanta, Georgia, Schendel, Autry, Wines, and Moore (2009) examined major birth defects (e.g., central nervous system/eye, cardiovascular, genitourinary, musculoskeletal, chromosomal syndromes, etc.) in ASD in relation to gender differences. Inconsistent with Miles and Hillman’s (2000), Miles et al.’s (2005) findings, sex ratios were higher in children with ASD and major birth defects (6.8:1) compared to the overall ASD sex ratio of 3.8:1. However, of those with major birth defects, the sex ratio was lower in those with a DD (i.e., ID, cerebral palsy, vision loss) in addition to ASD compared to ASD only (6.3:1 versus 8:1), though it is notable that few participants had birth defects and ASD without another DD (Schendel et al., 2009). Amiet et al. (2008) conducted a meta-analysis of epilepsy in ASD as related to ID and gender. Females had an increased relative risk of epilepsy, and the sex ratio of ASD was higher in individuals without epilepsy (3.5:1) than with epilepsy (close to 2:1). The prevalence of epilepsy was higher for individuals with ID (Amiet et al., 2008). Follow-up studies of adults diagnosed with ASD in childhood have shown higher rates of epilepsy in females (Billstedt et al., 2007; Danielsson et al., 2005), and epilepsy has been shown to be associated with the presence of greater intellectual and adaptive impairments (Danielsson et al., 2005). 4.10. Genetic models and linkage Twin studies have been employed to evaluate gender differences in models examining the contribution of genetic and both shared and unique environmental factors to ASD.
