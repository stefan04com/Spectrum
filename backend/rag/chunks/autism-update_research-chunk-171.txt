For a 1-unit increase in functional play types, there was a 2.12 (SE 0.55) standard score increase on the DAS. Children gained a standard score of 1.1 (SE =0.3) in spoken vocabulary ability per month that they enter the treatment earlier and they gain a standard score of 2.1 (SE =0.9) in spoken vocabulary ability per C-92 Diagnostic category, n (%): Autism (100) Other characteristics , n (%) : Expressive language age, mean/ mos ± SD: G1: 20.6± 6.508 G2: 23.18 ± 7.418 G3: 19.75 ± 7.819 Receptive language age, mean/ mos ± SD: G1: 20.55± 7.272 G2: 23.35 ± 9.380 G3: 17.94 ± 8.813 one frequency increase in joint attention initiations G1 scored an average of 12.5 (SE =5.8) points higher than G3 on the language measure, and G2 scores an average of 10.6 (SE = 6.2) points higher on the language measure than G3. No group difference (p=0.61). Harms: NR Modifiers Interactions of group and time were found for both types of joint attention quality. Comments: Used data from previous published RTC (Kasari et al 2006); Original study had 58 participants; 6 were not included in this analysis because portions of their ESCS data were missing. Kasari et al 2012 followed 40/58 children at 5 years and 8 years after intervention C-93 Table C-1. Evidence table, continued Study Description Intervention Inclusion/ Exclusion Criteria/ Population Baseline Measures Outcomes Author: Kasari et al. 2012 46 Country: US Intervention setting: School Enrollment period: August 2003 to September 2007 Funding: NIMH, HRSA, NCT Design: RCT Intervention : Child - assisted approach: Children with ASD given 20 min twice weekly sessions for 6 weeks with direct instruction, to develop strategies to engage socially with their peers Peer-mediated: Three classroom peers of child with ASD taught strategies for engaging children with social challenges on the playground. Training given for 20 min twice weekly sessions for 6 weeks Assessments: Social Network Survey, Teacher perception of social skills ( TPSS), Playground observation of peer engagement, behavioral assessment (direct observations, and peer, self and teacher reports) Groups *: G1: CHILD-assisted G2: PEER-mediated G3: Both PEER and CHILD Interventions Inclusion criteria: • met criteria for ASD on the ADI–R and ADOS administered by blind, • independent psychologists • fully included in a • regular education classroom for at least 80% of the school day • between the ages of 6–11 years old •
