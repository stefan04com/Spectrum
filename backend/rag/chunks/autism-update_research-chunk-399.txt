interventions as selected by parents • At followup, G1 received mean 1.48 hours treatment/week G2 received 3.68 (p<.05) • G2 had more severe social affect symptoms at baseline, poorer imitation and nonsocial orienting scores compared with G1 (p<.05) • No significant group differences on ADOS scores or measures of development at followup • Measures of parent acquisition of parent- child interaction skills did not differ between groups at followup • Social orienting and imitation skills were not found to be moderators of outcomes; increased hours of intervention and younger child age were significantly associated with improved developmental and vocabulary scores in a pooled analysis (p≤.05). In analyses by group, age and hours of intervention associated with improvements in vocabulary for G1 (p≤.05) • Parent stress decreased in G1 compared with G2 (p<.05) F-15 Author, Year, Country Groups, N Enrollment/N Final Study Quality Age, Mean Months ± SD IQ, Mean ± SD Intervention Provider Intervention Setting Intervention Manualized?
