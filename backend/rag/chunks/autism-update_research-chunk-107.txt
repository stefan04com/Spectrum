203 participants (mean age range: 30.2 to 42.5 months). The investigators rated all studies as having high risk of bias (low overall quality) and found positive effects for early intervention on all outcomes. Mean difference effect sizes were 0.76 for IQ (95% CI=0.40 to 1.11, p<.0001), 0.69 for adaptive behavior (95% CI=0.38 to 1.01, p<.0001) and ranged from 0.42 to 0.74 for measures of communication, socialization, and daily living skills (p values .0005 to .03). Tests of heterogeneity and small sample sizes precluded assessment of moderators of effects. One meta-analysis of ABA-based interventions included studies with at least five children with ASD receiving at least 10 hours of intervention per week for 45 weeks. Twenty-two studies met criteria and assessed outcomes including IQ, receptive and expressive language, and adaptive behavior (Vineland composite and subscales). Studies included 323 patients (mean age 22.6 to 66.3 months, 55.6 to 97% male). Study quality was low to moderate, ranging from 1.2 to 3.6 on a five point scale (mean 2.5). Thirteen studies had control groups (six with random/quasi- random assignment). Positive effects were associated with ABA-based intervention in 18 studies assessing the outcome with a pooled effect size of 1.19 (95% CI: 0.91 to 1.47, p<.001). Similarly, ABA was associated with positive effects on language (general, expressive, and receptive, effect sizes from 1.07 to 1.48) and adaptive behavior (communication, socialization, motor skills, daily living skills domains as well as composite scores; pooled effect sizes ranging from 0.61 to 1.45). The effect size for the composite score was 1.09 (95% CI: 0.70 to 1.47, p<.001), and total treatment duration was associated with better adaptive behavior and language outcomes but not IQ. Results restricted to studies with control groups were consistent with results for all studies across outcomes. Across outcomes, effect sizes were generally slightly better for clinic-based approaches vs. parent-delivered. Similarly, the investigators note the potential for publication bias for the outcomes of IQ and language and the adaptive behavior domains of communication and socialization. 52 Another meta-analysis of ABA-based early intervention included 11 small comparative studies (one RCT) with 344 children with ASD (mean age 33.56 to 65.68 months, 65.7% male). 197 The mean quality of studies as rated on the Downs and Black scale was 24.65 out of 32 (range 23-27). The early intervention group had greater gains on all variables assessed compared with control group participants, with full scale IQ improving by 11.98 points over improvements in the control group. Receptive and expressive language scores for the early intervention group compared with control each improved by more than 13 points, while improvements on Vineland subscales scores ranged from 4.96 to 10.44 points. Total effect sizes for daily living skills improvements were moderate (0.68) and were large for improvements in IQ, language, and adaptive behavior (effect sizes ranging from 0.91 to 2.00). The authors noted some evidence of publication bias. Table 18 outlines key characteristics of these early intervention meta-analyses.
