. This is a general statement with little specificity or measurability. On the other hand, in the second example given, the behavioral objective is stated as: When presented with 10 double-digit addition problems involving carrying, Jim will complete all problems with 90 percent accuracy within 10 minutes. Jim will be able to complete this task at this level for 2 consecutive days. In this case we know: ¡ Where the task is presented (in the classroom) ¡ How many problems are presented (10) ¡ What type of problems are presented (double-digit addition with carrying) In writing clear and measurable behavioral/educational objectives, it is important to use those verbs and related descriptors that are observable and measurable. Examples are given below: Observable Verbs Nonobservable Verbs to write to conclude to point to to appreciate to name to be aware to jump to discover to count orally to learn to develop Identify the Conditions Under Which the Behavior is to be Displayed A good behavioral/educational objective should include, when appropriate, conditions for performance, such as: ¡ What prompts the behavior: When presented with the verbal direction, Jim will… ¡ A list of required materials: Using the math workbook, Jim will… ¡ Characteristics of the environment: During school assemblies, Jim will… APPENDICES 44 In this way, myriad aspects of the individual instructional interaction can be presented in as consistent and productive a manner as possible. Identify Criteria for Competent Performance In this case, the definition of “success” is clearly stated: 90 percent accuracy in a 10-minute time frame, for at least 2 consecutive days. Once this objective is achieved as stated, Jim is to be considered competent at the task and ready to move on to the next objective. A solid IEP goal should always have similarly clear criteria, allowing team members to objectively determine success. Summary Creating an IEP for a child with autism is both an art and a science. Using clear language to write achievable objectives is the first step to success. The resource listed below provides more information on this important part of the educational process.

This guide presents a six-step plan for: • Preparing to have a student with autism in the classroom • Communicating and collaborating with the parents of a student with autism • Supporting the inclusive classroom environment • Collaborating with a student’s IEP team The Organization for Autism Research (OAR) is a national nonprofit organization
