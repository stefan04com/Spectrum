(b) highlight the ubiquitous nature of some treat- ment components that are used within nearly all of the of the identified evidence- based practices (e.g., reinforcement); and (c) indicate where each one of these treatments (or components) is discussed in this book. National Professional Development Center on Autism Spectrum Disorders The National Professional Development Center on Autism Spectrum Disorders (NPDC) classifies a treatment as an evidence-based practice for people with ASD when the treatment’s efficacy has been sufficiently evaluated in research published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Further, individual studies as well as the body of research considered as a whole must be sufficiently rigorous and replicated. Specifically, effectiveness must be demonstrated in at least (a) two high-quality experimental or quasi-experimental group designs demonstrating effectiveness, (b) three different research teams which must have produced five single-case design studies demonstrating effectiveness, or (c) a comparable combination of group designs and single-case designs with results replicated by at least three different research teams. Using this set of criteria, it is not possible for a practice to be clas- sified as evidence-based from only a single study nor is it possible for a single often includes prompting for the appropriate behavior and/or redirection for the challenging behavior. In this example, reinforcement, extinction, prompting, and redirection are all intervention components that make up the differential reinforcement treatment package. • A single intervention component and a package can both be classified as evidence-based using some criteria (NPDC), but only treatment packages are considered evidence-based in other criteria (Wong et al., 2013). 2 New Is Not Always Improved: Evidence-Based Practice infiPlay andfiSocial Skills… 23 Table 2.1 National professional development center on autism spectrum disorders evidence-based practices across chapters EBP identified by NPDC that can be used to teach social and play skills Treatment packages and components covered in this text Modeling and prompting (Chap. 3) Video modeling (Chap. 4) Visual and activity schedules (Chap. 5) Naturalistic teaching strategies (Chap. 6) Peer-mediated intervention (Chap. 7) Parent- implemented intervention (Chap. 8) National Professional Development Center on Autism Spectrum Disorders Differential reinforcement Component – – Component – Component Extinction – – – Component – Component Functional communication training Component – – – – Component Naturalistic interventions Component – – Main focus Component Component Parent-implemented interventions Component – – Component – Main focus Pivotal response training Component – – Component – Component Peer-mediated intervention Component – – Component Main focus – Prompting Main focus Component Component Component Component Component Reinforcement – – – Component Component Component Response interruption and redirection Component – – – – Component Social narratives Component – – – – – Social skills training groups Component – – – Component – Stimulus control Component Component Component Component Component Component Task analysis – – Component – – – Time delay Component – – Component – Component Video modeling Component Main focus – – – – Visual supports Component Component Main focus – – – Identifying Evidence-Based Practices for Children with ASD 24 Table 2.2 National autism center’s national standards
