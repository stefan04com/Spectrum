play compared with G2 • Greater caregiver quality of involvement predicted increased joint engagement Lawton et al. 2012 157 US G1: Immediate joint attention intervention, 9/9 G2: Delayed treatment, 7/7 Quality: Fair G1: 46.0±5.00 G2: 43.01±6.00 G1: 30.3±5.01 G2: 33.8±8.74 • Joint attention intervention delivered by preschool teachers. In classroom observations, G1 demonstrated greater initiations of joint attention vs. G2 (effect size=1.85, p<.005) and used more pointing and showing gestures (effect sizes 2.02, 1.85 respectively); no differences in looking or giving • Total joint attention scores on the Early Social Communication Scales did not differ between groups • On intervention exit play observations, no group differences in any joint attention skills • G1 demonstrated less object engagement (effect size=1.41) and more supported engagement (effect size=1.24) compared with G2 Kaale et al. 2012 155 Norway G1: Joint attention intervention, 34/34 G2: Control, 27/27 Quality: Fair G1: 47.6±8.30 G2: 50.3±8.3 G1: 53.3±19.2 G2: 59.9±19.7 • Joint attention intervention delivered by preschool teachers • G1 demonstrated more frequent joint attention skills in play with teachers vs. G2, with G1 nearly 5 times more likely to demonstrate initiation of joint attention vs. G2 (effect size=0.44); duration of joint engagement with teachers did not differ between groups • G1 spent longer time in jointly engaged play with mothers vs. G2 post-intervention (effect size=0.67); frequency of joint attention skills with mothers did not differ between groups • Frequency of joint attention measured on the Early Social Communication Scales did not differ between groups • Child age, language age, DQ, or preschool treatment approach did not moderate effects 54 Table 9. Summary of outcomes of studies of play/interaction-based interventions (continued) Author, Year, Country Groups, N Enrollment/N Final Study Quality Age, Mean Months±SD IQ, Mean±SD Key Outcomes Joint attention studies Wong 2013 158 US G1: Joint attention-symbolic play interventions, 14/14 G2: Symbolic play-joint attention intervention, 10/10 G3: Waitlist, 9/9 Quality: Fair G1: 56.2±10.4 G2: 54.5±5.1 G3: 59.7±10.6 NR • No group differences on measures of play or joint attention in classroom observations • Increased time in joint engaged state for G1 and G2 vs. G3 (effect size=0.63) • For G1+G2, joint engagement time, joint attention responses/minute, joint attention initiations/minute, symbolic play acts/minute increased significantly from baseline to post-intervention (effect sizes of 0.41, 0.43, 0.21, and 0.51 respectively) • Increases in joint attention responses from baseline for G1+G2 as measured on the Early Social Communication Scales; no significant increases in functional play level or structured play • No significant modifiers identified Warreyn et al. 2013 159 Belgium G1: Joint attention/imitation intervention, 18/18 G2: Treatment as usual, 18/18 Quality: Fair G1: 5.7±0.6 years G2: 5.7±0.7 years G1: 78.9±15.5 G2: 76.9±16.8 • Total joint attention scores more improved for G1 vs. G2 (p<.01); gaze following, initiating requests also significantly improved for G1 vs. G2 (p values <.05) • G1 increased number of elicited joint attention acts by 1.88, number spontaneous declarative joint attention actions by .83, and number correct imitations by 7.01 from baseline • Both groups combined improved in imitation
