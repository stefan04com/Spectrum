al., 1993). T.T. Rivet, J.L. Matson / Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders 5 (2011) 957–976 963 Lord et al. (1982) examined their findings according to age groups and found significant differences; however, no significant interaction emerged between age and gender. Regarding age, both with and without IQ covaried, children ages 5– 8 years showed greater eye–hand coordination and perceptual skills than 3–4-year olds, while children ages 3–6 years showed greater adaptive social skills than 7–8-year olds. With IQ as a covariate, 5–6-year olds showed fewer peculiar visual interests than the other age groups (Lord et al., 1982). Studies of ASD traits in the general population with a subgroup with ASD have yielded comparable results across the lifespan for children, adolescents, and adults without ID (Auyeung et al., 2008; Baron-Cohen et al., 2006; Baron-Cohen et al., 2001), as well as for toddlers (Allison et al., 2008). These studies have all revealed greater ASD traits in males in the general population. However, no gender differences were found in the subgroups with ASD. 4.3.3. Outcome Howlin, Goode, Hutton, and Rutter (2004) conducted a follow-up study of outcome in 68 adults with ASD and a performance IQ above 50. The average age when first seen was 7 years (range 3–15) and the average follow-up age was 29 years (range 21–48). Only 7 women were included in the sample, and they were similar in age, IQ, language, reading, and spelling ability (Howlin et al., 2004). No significant gender differences were found on measures of language level, abnormal use of language, repetitive, stereotyped behaviors, or overall social outcome. However, no females were rated as having a ‘‘Good’’ outcome, and five were rated as having ‘‘Poor’’ or ‘‘Very Poor’’ outcomes in areas of educational, vocational, residential, and social status (Howlin et al., 2004). Billstedt, Gillberg, and Gillberg (2007) conducted a follow-up study of 75 males and 30 females using the Diagnostic Interview for Social and Communication DisOrders (DISCO; Wing, Leekam, Libby, Gould, & Larcombe, 2002). The follow-up period ranged from 13 to 22 years and the average follow-up age was 26 years (range 17–40). Female gender was predictive of greater abnormalities in social interaction, but not impairments in reciprocal communication and limitation in self-chosen activities (Billstedt et al., 2007). It is notable that more females in this study had epilepsy, which has been associated with ID/greater brain dysfunction and, hence, risk for poorer outcomes (Danielsson, Gillberg, Billstedt, Gillberg, & Olsson, 2005). 4.4. Diagnosis Compared to males with ASD, females have been found to experience a lack of diagnosis, delay in diagnosis, and misdiagnosis with regard to ASD. In an early epidemiological study, Wing and Gould (1979) found that even when sex ratios were the same for severity of social impairment, males were 15 times more likely to be diagnosed with ASD compared to females. In a follow-up report of the 11 children seen in 1943, Kanner reported that the girls were referred to the clinic at later ages (6–8 years) compared to boys (2–6 years; Kanner, 1971).
