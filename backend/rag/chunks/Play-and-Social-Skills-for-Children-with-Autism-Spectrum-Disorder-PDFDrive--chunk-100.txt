We explained why video modeling is a viable and effective treatment for play and social skills and gave a number of examples. To further explain why visually based interventions are effec- tive for the children, specifically related to visual activity schedules and scripts, let’s take a look at what these interventions represent. Interventions for children with ASD can be presented in one of three modalities (see table below). The first is the auditory-temporal modality where information is provided in a transient mode and is perceived by hearing. This is when teaching is presented via verbal instructions that the children need to listen to. These verbal instructions are momentary, can be repeated, but do not stay permanently in the environment. That is, once they are spoken, these instructions are gone. An example of this is “Put
