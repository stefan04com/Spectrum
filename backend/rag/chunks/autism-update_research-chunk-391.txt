Classification improved for 3 G1 and 2 G2 participants and deteriorated for 2 children in G1 • Cognitive abilities (Mullen Scales) and overall Vineland raw scores improved in both groups (p<.001) over time; no significant differences between groups at followup; overall Vineland standard scores improved for both groups (p<.05) • Vineland motor skills domain decreased over time for both groups (p<.001) • Children in G1+G2 with lower severity (ADOS) improved significantly more than those with higher severity on cognitive and adaptive measures; both groups declined on measures of motor skills, with greater decline for those with higher severity • G2 participants with lower severity improved significantly on Vineland communication and socialization measures compared with G1 (p<.001) F-4 Author, Year, Country Groups, N Enrollment/N Final Study Quality Age, Mean Months ± SD IQ, Mean ± SD Intervention Provider Intervention Setting Intervention Manualized? Intervention Intensity, Duration, And Focus Key Outcomes therapist, cognitive trainer, music therapist, teacher’s aids G1+G2: Autism- specific preschools • In analyses combining G1 and G2, higher cognitive abilities at baseline, particularly verbal abilities, and older maternal age were associated with greater adaptive skills at followup (p<.05) • Among those with greater severity, greater verbal ability was associated with better adaptive skills at followup (r=.672, p<.001) • Cognitive gains were greater for those with lower severity (p<.01) and older, more educated mothers (p values <.001, .05); younger children had a better chance of cognitive improvement with intervention (p=NS) Strain et al. 2011 5 US G1 : LEAP program with coaching and training, 28 classrooms (27 analyzed)/177 children G2 : LEAP intervention manuals only, 28 classrooms (23 analyzed)/117 children Quality: Fair G1: 50.1 ± 4.6 G2: 50.7 ± 4.2 G1: 59.6 ± 6.9 G2: 63.2 ± 6.6 G1+G2: Preschool teachers G1+G2: Preschool G1+G2: Yes G1: 2 years intervention, mean 17 hours/week (teachers received 23 full days coaching/training), peer mediated social skills, incidental teaching, pivotal response training, PECS, positive behavior support G2: 2 years intervention, mean 17 hours/week, intervention as above, no specific training for teachers beyond provision of LEAP manual • Significant gains on CARS, language, cognitive, and social skills measures for G1 vs. G2 (p<.05) • G1 improved by 18.5 points compared with 9.4 for G2 on the Preschool Language Scale (effect size difference=0.92, p<.01) • G1 improved by 28.6 points compared with 12 for G2 on socials skills rating (effect
