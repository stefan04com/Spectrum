Kopp and Gillberg (1992) reported case histories of 6 females between 6 and 10 years with ASD and an IQ above 60. None were diagnosed with ASD prior to age 6 (4 were over 8 years), even though abnormal development and social, communicative, and imaginative deficits had been identified before 2 years. Previous impressions had included ADHD, minimal brain dysfunction, developmental delay, and speech and motor concerns (Kopp & Gillberg, 1992; Miniscalco & Sandburg, 2010). Finally, researchers have found undiagnosed ASD in females with anxiety (Kopp & Gillberg, 1997) and anorexia nervosa (Nilsson, Gillberg, Gillberg, & Ra ˚ stam, 1999). Two more recent studies have examined gender differences in diagnostic experiences in ASD. Goin-Kochel, Abbacchi, and Constantino (2007) found that girls were diagnosed later for Asperger’s disorder (average of 8.9 versus 7.0 years) and PDD- NOS (5.1 versus 3.9 years), but not autistic disorder (3.7 versus 3.3 years). No significant gender differences were found for number of professionals seen, though this was positively correlated with age at diagnosis. Earlier age at diagnosis was associated with greater parental education, income, and satisfaction with the diagnostic process (Goin-Kochel, Mackintosh, & Myers, 2006). Siklos and Kerns (2007) found that parents of a female with ASD experienced significantly more difficulty during the diagnostic process. The time frame from the first visit to a health care professional to a final diagnosis was significantly longer for females (average of 4 years 2 months) compared to that for males (2 years 2 months). Age at diagnosis was later for females (6 years 1 months) compared to males (4 years 8 months). Despite these differences, there were no significant gender differences in the number of professionals seen during the diagnostic process or reports of satisfaction and stress levels (Siklos & Kerns, 2007). 4.5. Psychopathology Rutter et al. (2003) reviewed the literature on gender differences in psychopathology in general, grouping these differences into two main categories. First are neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., autism, ADHD, reading disorder), characterized by onset during childhood and greater prevalence in males (Rutter et al., 2003). The second category encompasses emotional disorders (e.g., depression, eating disorders), characterized by onset during adolescence and greater prevalence in females (Rutter et al., 2003). Although antisocial behavior has adolescent onset and male preponderance, the male to female ratio is much higher when onset is during childhood (Moffitt & Caspi, 2001; Moffitt, Caspi, Rutter, & Silva, 2001). Few studies have examined gender differences in psychopathology in ASD. In participants with ASD and an IQ above 70, Holtmann et al. (2007) found females had higher thought problems and attention problems (CBCL), but no significant gender differences on the CBCL Somatic, Anxious/Depressed, Delinquent, or Aggressive Behavior subscales. Bo ¨ lte, Dickhut, and T.T. Rivet, J.L. Matson / Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders 5 (2011) 957–976 964 Poustka (1999) found no significant gender differences in individuals with ASD ages 4–18 on the CBCL with age and IQ covaried. Matson and Love (1990) examined parent-reported fears in 2.5–17-year olds with and without ASD. Overall, average
