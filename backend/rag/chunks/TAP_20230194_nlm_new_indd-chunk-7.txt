very negative impact on the public health service, due to the large human and material resources that must be employed to address the problem on the diagnostic and therapeutic sides. However, it should be clear that what we do for today's autistic children will inevitably affect tomorrow’s autistic adults. Spending many resources on treatments for individuals with ASD in their devel- opmental age in order to give them as much personal auton- omy as possible, for example in terms of communication skills, is an investment for the future as it reduces the risk of chal- lenging behaviors arising in adolescence or adulthood, which in turn involve the prolonged use of large resources.
