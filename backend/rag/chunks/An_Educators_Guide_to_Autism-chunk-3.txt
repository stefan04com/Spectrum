It is an awesome responsibility faithfully carried out by education professionals across the country every day. No doubt, your studies leading to a degree in education and a position as an educator have prepared you well for the challenge of teaching. But are you prepared for teaching children with developmental disabilities like autism in an inclusive classroom, along with your regular students? Autism is a developmental disorder that occurs in 1 out of every 166 births and affects males more often than females by a 4:1 ratio. This brain-based disorder affects a child’s ability to communicate and interact socially and typically becomes evident within the first 3 years of life. The cause of autism remains unknown, and there is no known cure. It presents a lifelong challenge to those diagnosed and their families. In the past 30 years, the prevalence rate of autism has skyrocketed, and it continues to rise. The most recent estimate provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia, indicates that autism occurs in 1 out of every 166 births as compared to the 1 in 2,000 − 2,500 rate estimated in the 1970s. Why the increase? No one knows for sure. Some epidemiologists point to a broader definition of autism and increasing awareness of autism among medical professionals as the key contributing factors. Research on environmental factors that may be at work is also ongoing. All we know with any degree of certainty is that autism is a brain-based disorder that has far-reaching implications for a child’s development and, because of this dramatic rise in the incidence of autism, more and more children with autism and related developmental disabilities are being taught in inclusive settings. The effect of this increase in autism prevalence on education is profound. Since the passage of the Individual with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) in 1975, more children with disabilities, including autism, are in the general education classroom. Chances are a child with autism is in your school, if not in your class. As a teacher in this inclusive environment, your goal—as well as your school’s—is to foster an environment that supports all learners. To do that effectively requires education, understanding, and patience. For the child with autism and his or her family, the disorder is a lifelong challenge. School is a challenging environment because it places the child in a setting outside the home where communication and socialization ⎯ areas of significant
