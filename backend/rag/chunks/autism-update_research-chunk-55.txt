groups, although G1 vs. G2-4 and G2 vs. G3-4 approached significance (p<.06) • Composite change scores were inversely related to initial ASD severity for G2-G4 but positively related for G1; the strength of that relationship only differed significantly between G1 and G3 (p<.05) • As time in intervention increased, composite scores improved for G2-G4 but worsened for G1 (p<.05). No differences were found in the amount of improvement between G2-4 Pajareya et al. 2011 92 Thailand G1: DIR/Floortime,16/15 G2: Usual care, 16/16 Quality: Fair G1: 56.6±10.1 G2: 51.5±13.9 NR • G1 improved significantly on the Functional Emotional Assessment Scale compared with G2 (p=.045) • CARS scores decreased (improved) for G1 vs. G2 (mean change 2.9 vs. 0.8, p=.004) • G1 scores on parent-rated measure of emotional development significantly improved compared with G2 (mean change 7.7 vs. 0.8, p=.007) Carter et al. 2011 93 US G1 : More than Words, 32/29 G2 : Control, 30/26 Quality: Fair G1: 21.11±2.71 G2 : 21.51±2.82 NR • No treatment effect on parental responsivity • G1 showed differential effects on child communication depending on a baseline child factor • Children with lower levels of baseline object interest exhibited facilitated growth in communication • Children with higher levels of object interest exhibited growth attenuation 38 Table 7.
