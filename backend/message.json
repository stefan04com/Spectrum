ORGANIZATION FOR AUTISM RESEARCH Research and resources that help families today! Dear Fellow Parents and Friends, A Parent’s Guide to Research was the very first resource we published back in 2003. OAR wasn’t even two years old then. That original guide would go on to be the first of what are now nine publications in the Life Journey Through Autism series. We published it hop - ing that it would help parents, especially when first confronted with their child’s autism diagnosis. As we publish this updated version, the difference between then and now is that we know from more than 15 years of constant demand that it is the tool for parents we had hoped it would be at the start—a useful resource to support them as they become familiar with their son’s or daughter’s diagnosis. For parents of children with autism, there is one constant. From the moment your child is diagnosed, you need reliable information about this complex dis - order. Most parents face a daunting learning curve when plunged into this new world of information replete with unfamiliar medical and scientific terminology. We quickly discover there is no single source or national clearinghouse for infor - mation on autism. It may seem unfair, but it falls upon us parents to educate ourselves. I understand how difficult this can be because I’ve walked that path. I have a son and daughter with autism, both now in their thirties. When we founded OAR, one of our foremost objectives was to deliver practi - cal information and tools to ease the burden on the front-line caregivers—mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, grandparents, teachers, classroom assistants, and others who face the everyday challenges presented by autism.

That said, the credit for this version goes to Kimberly Ha, OAR research and programs director; and Nancy McIntyre, Ph.D., and Sallie Nowell, Ph.D., CCC-SLP, from the Frank Porter Graham Institute, who worked tirelessly on the project for the last six months.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder that typically appears by 3 years of age and impacts an individual’s ability to engage in recipro- cal communication and social interaction skills, along the presence of repetitive patterns of thought and behavior. For example, common effects of the disorder include: Difficulty understanding social cues and figurative language Persistent preoccupation with objects or specific topics of interest Limited communication or repetitive speech Lack of eye contact Hyper- or hyposensitivity to external stimuli The degree to which these areas of development are affected varies significantly. For example, some individuals have no verbal language abilities, while others have language capabilities similar to those of their peers. This variation in the severity of symptoms is often referred to as the autism spectrum. Throughout this guide, autism spectrum disorders will be referred to as autism. For detailed informa- tion on the diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorders, refer to the American Psychiatric Association’s (2013) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.; DSM-5). How Many Children Have Autism? According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2018), approx- imately 1 out of 59 children in the United States is diagnosed with autism. The disorder affects children across all cultures and socioeconomic groups, but is four times more likely to be diagnosed in boys than in girls. However, recent studies indicate that a potential gender bias may be inherent in existing diagnostic tools. Therefore, there is a need to develop diagnostic tools that can accurately detect autism in girls. What to Do When Your Child Has Been Diagnosed with Autism For most parents, the diagnosis of autism may be emotionally challenging. You may feel overwhelmed by your child’s diagnosis; it is natural and understandable that you feel this way. At the same time, you need to know that through informed action and the use of appropriate treatments and interventions, you can enhance the quality of your child’s life. 1Introduction"

What to Do When Your Child Has Been Diagnosed with Autism For most parents, the diagnosis of autism may be emotionally challenging. You may feel overwhelmed by your child’s diagnosis; it is natural and understandable that you feel this way. At the same time, you need to know that through informed action and the use of appropriate treatments and interventions, you can enhance the quality of your child’s life. 1Introduction Research being conducted in the field of autism has yielded options from which you and the professionals on your child’s team can choose to support your child. While it is not yet possible to accurately predict how much progress a given child will make, the consensus within the medical and educational communities is that early intervention can greatly improve the quality of life for many children diagnosed with ASD. This guide will help you become a better consumer of infor- mation about autism. What a Parent Can Expect Following the Diagnosis Your child’s diagnosis of autism may be difficult to understand and accept—not just for you, but also for siblings, extended family members, and friends of the family. Parents and other loved ones often experience a wide range of emotions after the diagnosis—from confusion to anger, from hope to despair. Local parent groups are a great source of emotional support and guidance to other resources, not just right after the diagnosis but throughout your journey with autism. Attending informational sessions and meetings will not only raise your knowledge and skill level, but also enable you to develop a support net - work. Support may also be obtained from counselors or autism organizations at the local, state, and national levels, as well as social media groups. You will likely find the most direct support at the local level, with more comprehensive and general autism information available at the state and national levels. Contact information for some of the national autism organizations may be found in the Autism Resources section on page 37 of this guide. Become an Informed Consumer of Information It is necessary to spend a significant amount of time and effort in order to become a knowledgeable consumer of information regarding treatment claims. For example, general information on autism that can be found online may be full of false hope and anecdotal information. You are the primary advocate for your child until your child develops the necessary skills to advocate for themselves. As your child’s advocate, it is important to be able to evaluate your child’s needs as well as the research supporting various autism interventions that may be appropriate for your child. There is no central resource for autism information. Compounding matters, opinions about the best methods of treatment may conflict. As a result, you must gather information from a variety of sources, including websites, mass media, research journals, reports from conferences and workshops, and education and health providers. In addition, networking with other parents and educational or medical professionals can help you identify sources of information that have been most useful to others. In short, what you choose for your personal approach will 2 Life Journey Through Autism: A Parent’s Guide to Research"

Parents and other loved ones often experience a wide range of emotions after the diagnosis—from confusion to anger, from hope to despair. Local parent groups are a great source of emotional support and guidance to other resources, not just right after the diagnosis but throughout your journey with autism. Attending informational sessions and meetings will not only raise your knowledge and skill level, but also enable you to develop a support net - work. Support may also be obtained from counselors or autism organizations at the local, state, and national levels, as well as social media groups. You will likely find the most direct support at the local level, with more comprehensive and general autism information available at the state and national levels. Contact information for some of the national autism organizations may be found in the Autism Resources section on page 37 of this guide. Become an Informed Consumer of Information It is necessary to spend a significant amount of time and effort in order to become a knowledgeable consumer of information regarding treatment claims. For example, general information on autism that can be found online may be full of false hope and anecdotal information. You are the primary advocate for your child until your child develops the necessary skills to advocate for themselves. As your child’s advocate, it is important to be able to evaluate your child’s needs as well as the research supporting various autism interventions that may be appropriate for your child. There is no central resource for autism information. Compounding matters, opinions about the best methods of treatment may conflict. As a result, you must gather information from a variety of sources, including websites, mass media, research journals, reports from conferences and workshops, and education and health providers. In addition, networking with other parents and educational or medical professionals can help you identify sources of information that have been most useful to others. In short, what you choose for your personal approach will 2 Life Journey Through Autism: A Parent’s Guide to Research likely end up coming from a number of different sources and include a variety of approaches. A word of caution: Beware of those who claim to have a cure . Your hopes for your child may leave you vulnerable to those marketing a variety of educational, medical, and other alternative treatments for autism that have no proof of effec - tiveness. Given your heartfelt wish to help and support your child, an emotional appeal from such promoters can be difficult to resist. Although many proponents of various treatments truly believe in their products or services, few fads or mir - acle cures hold up when scientifically tested. The time you and your child spend on researching and going through treatments is finite; use it wisely. One purpose of this guide is to provide you with some basic tools for evalu - ating the validity of treatment claims. These tools can also be used to evaluate the research studies that support them. Specifically, the guide gives you a basic understanding of the purpose of research, how it is conducted, and the criteria to use when judging its value. Armed with this information, you are better equipped to ask the right questions of your child’s doctors, therapists, and teachers about specific interventions or treatment options.

Amidst all the information out there, it can be difficult to distinguish between reputable and questionable sources. This section provides guidance on where and how to search for resources on autism and autism research, followed by suggestions for how to evaluate the information you find. News, Social Media, and Blogs Always be critical about what you read or watch in the news, whether it is online, on television, or in print. Even well-known and credible reporters may grossly simplify or misinterpret research. Reporters work in an environment that requires them to synthesize information from multiple topic areas in a short amount of time to meet publication deadlines. Thus, although they may not intentionally misinterpret research, in summarizing information for a general audience, they may overlook or oversimplify key points or limitations of research. In addition, reporters are more likely to interview people who have had extreme responses to a treatment—either finding it very effective or “miracle-working” or dangerously ineffective or harmful. Neither of these types of scenarios is likely to be repre - sentative of the average person who uses a given treatment approach. Therefore, make sure to review the original research article and ask a professional before deciding if a treatment discussed in a news article is appropriate for your child. In 2018, the Pew Research Center reported that social media has surpassed print newspapers as a source of news information in the United States, and more than two thirds of adults use Facebook. Social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest, use algorithms to determine the content that is most likely to be of interest to users. This means that if you have clicked on links or “liked” posts within social media, content related to those links will appear more often on your main page or newsfeed. That is, social media sites attempt to predict what you want to see in the future based on your past interactions with friends or brands. Unfortunately, this can put you in a vulnerable position because, for example, “liking” a post about a child with autism sleeping through the night can lead to a deluge of advertisements and articles on your newsfeed about sleep and autism—whether you want them or not. The news disseminated via social media usually has short headlines that are overly dramatic, emotion-provoking, or sensationalized to entice consumers scrolling through their newsfeed to click and read more. They may promote fixes or cures for autism or autism symptoms. Some of them will even intentionally try 7How to be a Savvy Consumer of Sources of Autism Information"

They may give testimonials about their experiences using products or resources that they want to share with other parents. Some parents use blogs to generate positive support and community around their experiences raising a child with autism, while others use blogs to vent about their challenges. Humans have been sharing parenting success and failure stories like this for centuries, but in the age of social media, you are more likely to hear such stories from people you do not know. Keep in mind that bloggers typically are only writ- ing about their individual experiences, and their perspective may be influenced by multiple factors. What works for one child does not necessarily work for all children. Furthermore, some bloggers receive products from brands and are paid to review them in their blog posts. Unfortunately, that is not always made clear to readers, which leads to confusion. To further complicate things, because social media users often click on sensationalized headlines, some credible news sources now use bold headlines to attract attention. To filter through this information, use the following general guidelines for reading social media posts: Look at who posted the article. Is it someone that you know and trust? Is it from a group, organization, or news source that is credible, like a univer- sity-based autism program or federal department? Avoid clicking posts that say “sponsored,” “promoted,” or “advertise - ment.” These words may appear in small print at the top or bottom of the post, so look carefully. 8 Life Journey Through Autism: A Parent’s Guide to Research"

Television, newspapers, and magazines report scientific research “second hand,” in a brief way that is easily understandable to the public. In their reports, journalists may cite the author and name of the professional journal in which the research was published, but many of the details of the research may be left out. For the most part, journalists do a good job reporting the research, but it is important to remember that there is no scientific process to make sure that what journalists report is accurate. Therefore, to determine that the research is interpreted and reported accurately, it is best to get the report “first hand” by reading the original published research. Professional journals report research by the scientists who conducted the studies and vary in quality and rigor. The research reported in journals is usually submitted through a process called “peer review.” During a peer review, other researchers read and comment on the quality of the research, including whether it adheres to the ethical and quality standards of the profession, and then make a decision about acceptance, the need for revisions and reconsideration, or rejec - tion. To determine if an article is published in a peer-reviewed journal, you can read the instructions to authors for submission of articles, which should describe the review process. There is a great deal of competition to publish, so articles that appear in journals have usually been examined very carefully. However, this does not mean that all limitations are identified; this typically does not happen until subsequent studies from other researchers are published. This guide will help you find these first-hand or original scientific publications and determine if they are applicable to your child. Websites Many websites cover the topic of autism; unfortunately, not all websites are good sources of information. Without some experience or training, it can be difficult to discriminate among websites. The websites for the national autism organiza - tions provided in the list of autism resources on page 37 offer sound information on selected topics. Many of them also provide links to other sites and scientific articles on autism. Some characteristics of websites that provide avenues to quality autism research include the following: Provide links to other major autism organizations, academic research insti- tutions, and professional research articles; Hosted by government agencies or educational institutions (which often end in .gov, or .edu); and Clearly cite sources of information. 10 Life Journey Through Autism: A Parent’s Guide to Research"

The research reported in journals is usually submitted through a process called “peer review.” During a peer review, other researchers read and comment on the quality of the research, including whether it adheres to the ethical and quality standards of the profession, and then make a decision about acceptance, the need for revisions and reconsideration, or rejec - tion. To determine if an article is published in a peer-reviewed journal, you can read the instructions to authors for submission of articles, which should describe the review process. There is a great deal of competition to publish, so articles that appear in journals have usually been examined very carefully. However, this does not mean that all limitations are identified; this typically does not happen until subsequent studies from other researchers are published. This guide will help you find these first-hand or original scientific publications and determine if they are applicable to your child. Websites Many websites cover the topic of autism; unfortunately, not all websites are good sources of information. Without some experience or training, it can be difficult to discriminate among websites. The websites for the national autism organiza - tions provided in the list of autism resources on page 37 offer sound information on selected topics. Many of them also provide links to other sites and scientific articles on autism. Some characteristics of websites that provide avenues to quality autism research include the following: Provide links to other major autism organizations, academic research insti- tutions, and professional research articles; Hosted by government agencies or educational institutions (which often end in .gov, or .edu); and Clearly cite sources of information. 10 Life Journey Through Autism: A Parent’s Guide to Research Examples of websites that provide access to quality autism research and resources include: Association for Science in Autism Treatment: https://asatonline.org Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, section dedicated to research on ASD: https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/research.html National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Newsroom: https://www.nichd.nih.gov/newsroom/news?topic=autism Spectrum, an independent website covering autism research news that originated as part of the Simons Foundation’s website (SFARI.org): https://www.spectrumnews.org Medline Plus, a National Institutes of Health website that provides up-to-date health and wellness information: https://medlineplus.gov /autismspectrumdisorder.html National Professional Development Center on Autism Spectrum Disorders, a collaborative project that identifies evidence-based practices for individuals with ASD: https://autismpdc.fpg.unc.edu/national -professional-development-center-autism-spectrum-disorder Searchable Online Databases Searchable online databases are very good sources of information about autism research.

However, with perseverance and practice, you can learn to comfortably navigate scientific writing for the purposes of making informed treatment decisions for your child. This section is written to give you a basic understanding of the scientific model under lying research studies. What Can Research Do? Before examining the structure of individual research studies, it is helpful to understand science and research as a whole. Science is the iterative and systematic process of studying the nature and behavior of natural things. As such, scientists make observations, ask questions, and generate and test hypotheses through well- designed studies in order to draw conclusions and pose new questions. Science is often a decades-long process of acquiring new information that builds upon pre - viously gained knowledge and adapts it into existing frameworks. Many studies from different locations using different methods that converge on the same results are needed for the findings to be accepted within the research community. Study findings may be tentative until they are sufficiently reinforced or rejected through future research. For this reason, it is important to get a broad reading of many research studies, not just a few. For example, scientists have observed developmental differences between infants who are typically developing and infants who are at high risk for autism. Based on the research community’s collective findings in this area, screening tools have been developed in an effort to detect early indicators of autism among children in the general population. The next step, then, is to evaluate the imple - mentation and quality of these screening tools, and conduct follow-up studies to improve them, as necessary. More specifically, if it is found that certain screen - ing tools are more or less sensitive to gender differences, for example, researchers may go on to develop more sensitive screening tools designed to be used with that population, and then test the effectiveness of those. Through unbiased and itera - tive research, we are able to solidify our understanding of autism and improve existing tools and interventions.

The Difference Between Basic and Applied Research There are two kinds of research: basic research and applied research. Both types of research are necessary to advance science and apply the findings to the benefit of society. 15Understanding the Scientific Model Basic research is designed to answer questions about a fundamental or basic problem for the purpose of advancing knowledge. Applied research, on the other hand, is concerned with solving practical, everyday problems, often by applying the knowledge gained through basic research. For instance, through basic research, we might learn that children with autism who have adequate verbal skills need less support in an academic setting than children with poor verbal skills. Using this information—gained through basic research—an applied researcher might then design a study to see if a particular intervention program designed to increase verbal skills in preschool children with autism increases their readiness for school. Basic research is usually conducted in a laboratory or clinical setting, such as university and medical laboratories. Applied research, on the other hand, is usu - ally conducted in everyday settings, such as homes, schools, and other community settings. Examining a Study A research study is designed to investigate a particular topic. A study begins with a research question, such as: “How does the play behavior of children with autism differ from the play behavior of typically developing children?” Once a research question has been posed, the researcher designs a study to attempt to answer it. Five Basic Types of Research Studies There are five basic types of research studies, each designed to answer different kinds of questions. The five types (A−E) of studies are discussed below. (Appendix C pro- vides an example of each type of study.) A. Case Studies: Case studies look at a single subject (e.g., a child with autism) or a single case (e.g., a classroom for children with autism). Case studies are typically used in research that describes the development of an individ- ual, group, or situation over a period of time in order to provide a detailed account of what is occurring within its real-life context. The advantage of a case study is that it allows the researcher to gather a lot of information about one person or one case. The disadvantage of a case study is that the information gathered about one person or a small group of people cannot readily be applied or generalized to other people or other cases in other situ- ations or other settings and, therefore, may be of limited use. 16 Life Journey Through Autism: A Parent’s Guide to Research"

Correlational Studies: Correlational studies look for a relationship between two or more variables, or things, that naturally occur in the same environ - ment. Correlational studies cannot tell us anything about cause and effect, only that there is a relationship between two or more things. For example, a study might be designed to determine if there is a relationship between the number of children with autism in a particular community and the month of their birth. Figure 1 presents a bar graph of a study of number of children with autism and month of birth. The graph illustrates that more children with autism were born in the winter months (November, December, and January) than in the summer, spring, or fall. Figure 1. Correlational study: Children with autism and month of birth. Although this graph shows a relationship between cases of autism in one community and month of birth, we cannot make the assumption that a winter birthday causes autism. Perhaps some other variable that we have not consid- ered (such as an illness) is having an effect on the two variables under study.

The best research design for answering this question would be to follow one cohort of children with autism that spent time in both envi - ronments. In Figure 2, this design is presented with a line graph. Figure 2. Longitudinal study: Self-contained vs. inclusive classrooms. Classrooms Grade 1 Grade 2 Grade 3 Grade 4 45 50 55 60 65 70 As illustrated in the graph, children in this cohort performed better in grades 1 and 4 when they were in inclusive classrooms than in grades 2 and 3 when they were in self-contained environments. D. Experimental Studies: Experimental studies are used to study cause and effect. Experiments are controlled so that the researcher manipulates one variable to determine its effect on other variables. Two primary types of experimental studies are used in intervention development and testing: randomized group design and single-case design. The first type includes experimental group designs in which participants are randomly assigned either to receive the intervention (the experimental The advantage of longitudinal studies is that they allow research- ers to pinpoint times during development when changes occur. The disadvantage of longitudinal studies is that it takes a long time to complete them. (Note that in the example in Figure 2, the study took four years to complete.)

The control group completes all the same steps as the experimental group, except they do not receive the interven - tion that is under investigation. Therefore, if the study is well controlled, it can be concluded that the differences between the experimental and control groups at the end of the study are due to the intervention. A common type of experimental study is an intervention study testing the effectiveness of a treatment program on outcomes such as performance scores. Using the above example, the intervention that is manipulated by the researcher is the “educational program.” In this study, subjects in the experimental group would receive the new intervention program, while subjects in the control group would receive a standard (or “services as usual”) program. The purpose of the study would be to determine if the test scores of students receiving the new intervention method would be higher than the scores of the students receiving the standard method. The advantage of randomized experimental studies is that the research design allows researchers to examine cause-and-effect relationships. The disadvantage of a randomized experimental study is that the results cannot always be generalized to the real world. This is because this kind of study lacks “real-world” authenticity; that is, what occurs in a controlled environment of a study may be very different from what might occur in a real-life setting, such as a typical classroom. A cornerstone of experimental group design research is the concept of randomization. That is, participants are randomly assigned from the pop- ulation to either the experimental group or the control group so that the groups will be exactly the same. Only if the groups are exactly the same can the researcher determine if the differences between them at the end of the study are due to the intervention. Figure 3 illustrates the randomized experimental method of research. A second type of experimental study frequently used in intervention research is single-case design (SCD). Many studies involving children with autism, particularly those examining behavioral and educational treat- ments, use single-case designs. Rather than examining differences across participant groups that do and do not receive an intervention, single-case designs involve individual participants or a small cluster of participants who provide their own control for comparison. For example, a researcher may be interested in determining whether a new communication interven- tion tool on tablet devices improves communication skills. First, the researchers might enroll three children in the study and col - lect baseline data by measuring their usual communication performance over multiple days ( baseline phase).

Where Is the Evidence? Many different types of interventions, programs, and practices have been devel - oped to address the challenges that autism presents. However, not all of these practices are supported by scientific research. Current laws governing the U.S. education system require the use of evidence-based practices in schools. Similarly, many health insurance providers determine reimbursement rates for health ser - vices based on the extent to which these are evidence-based.

The following is a list of definitions to help you understand how systematic research translates to practical implementation. Evidence-based research (EBR) uses previous research in a systematic way to inform the development of new research to ensure that it is answering valid and relevant questions in an efficient manner. Evidence-based practices (EBPs) are interventions that researchers have shown to be effective through an accumulation of evidence from multiple high- quality scientific studies. While many interventions have been created for children with ASD, scientific research has found that only some of them are effective when implemented correctly in school or clinical settings. Research-based practices (RBPs) are interventions that are backed by theories but have not been shown to be effective. That is, components of the intervention may have some research behind them that demonstrated they are effective, but the intervention as a whole has not been demonstrated to be effective by independent, rigorous research. The term RBPs is sometimes used interchangeably with EBPs, but the two are not the same. Although RBPs may hold some promise, there is not enough evidence (i.e., a sufficient number of high-quality studies with consistent results) to suggest that they are effective. 21Understanding the Scientific Model"

When you see a claim about a product or intervention that is based on the claims of one or more individuals’ experiences, it means there is no scientific evidence that the claim is true. Systematic reviews synthesize information gathered across many individual studies conducted to answer the same question. The evidence of effectiveness is gathered across multiple studies and is combined to provide a comprehensive summary. Many clinicians use systematic reviews to inform their practice, as a single study is not sufficient to show that something is effective. An accumulation of evidence is necessary to say with certainty that a practice is evidence-based. It is also important for practitioners to use the best research evidence possible to make decisions about the care of an individual patient or student. This evidence is integrated with clinical expertise, patient values, and preferences. Your child’s education and healthcare providers should be practicing in this manner.

Just by reading the abstract summary of the systematic review, you will see that the authors have concluded that the evidence does not support this therapy. Systematic reviews allow you to maximize your research time by giving you a broad overview of a large body of scientific literature; if a particular study is mentioned that you are interested in reading further about, you can search for it and examine for yourself whether or not it is relevant to your child’s needs. 22 Life Journey Through Autism: A Parent’s Guide to Research"

This section will help you read and analyze research articles by providing you with a framework for evaluating them. First, it is helpful to know that the standard structure of a research article consists of six sections in the following order: (1) Abstract, (2) Background or Introduction, (3) Methods or Methodology, (4) Results, (5) Discussion, and (6) References. You may find that some journals use a different format; nevertheless, you can still use this standard format as a guide for evaluating a research article. As you review research articles, use the sample worksheets in Appendix D to help you summarize and critically evaluate them. Abstract The abstract of an article presents a summary of the research study. Its purpose is to provide the reader with a brief overview or synopsis of the article. As a general rule, the abstract contains a sentence or two from the first five sections of the article (see above), and usually includes the following key points: The purpose of the study, or why the authors think it was important to con- duct this specific research Information about the participants in the study; their ages, ethnic back - ground, etc. The research procedure used in the study The major results or findings of the study A summary of the findings of the study and why they are important Often, as a first step in conducting research, the only section from an article that is needed is the abstract.

Therefore, research articles begin by summarizing previous research on the topic of interest to provide a framework or add context for the present study. When referring to other research, authors cite the author and date of publication of each study, either in the text or at the end of a sentence, as illustrated in the box below.

So, if during your reading you come across a previous study that sounds interesting, you can retrieve the full reference at the end of the article. An Example of Background Information In a previous study, Jones, Meyers, and Klein (2017) found that children with autism take longer to learn new tasks than other children. This finding has been confirmed in other numerous studies (Brown & Rogers, 2014; Roberts, 2005; Williamson et al., 2016). After summarizing previous research, authors state how their study adds to other research that has already been done. What is the research question and hypothesis guiding the study? Typically, authors state their research question(s) in the introduction and make a hypothesis about what they expect the study to find. A research question states the topic broadly, while a hypothesis makes a specific pre - diction about what the researcher expects to find. Authors design a research study to answer a research question and/or test a hypothesis. A study can answer one or more research questions. The boxes below provide examples of a research question and a hypothesis. An Example of a Research Question Does early intervention make a difference in the need for special education services once children with autism are in elementary school?

Research Design This section tells the reader about the design of the study. Things to look for include: What type of study was used in the research? Sometimes, the authors tell the reader what type of study they used (case studies, longitudinal studies, experimental studies, etc.). Often, however, the type of study is not explicitly stated, but clues will be evident in the study design. See Appendix C for examples of the different types of studies. Where was the research conducted? Was it conducted in a laboratory, clinic, or “real-world” setting? Subjects This section tells the reader about the people who participated in the study. Important points to look for include: How many subjects were included in the study? With the exception of case studies, which are frequently based on only one subject or one case, it is important to know how many subjects were used in the study. As a general rule, the more subjects that were involved, the more representative they are of the population under investigation. However, it is important to bear in mind that research involving people with disorders such as autism generally have fewer subjects than studies that use par - ticipants from the general population. This is because there are simply fewer people with autism overall. What are the characteristics of the subjects in the study? It is important to know something about the characteristics of the subjects in the study, such as their age and gender, to determine if they are representative of the larger population under investigation. For example, we know that among children with autism, four boys are diagnosed to every one girl. Therefore, we would expect a valid and reliable study on children with autism to show a similar ratio. 25A Uniform Framework for Evaluating Research Studies"

With special populations, however, it can be difficult to recruit a diverse group of participants. In addition, many studies are conducted in laboratories or special schools where participants volunteer to participate. In such cases, the subjects are self-selected , and may not be representative of the general population. What are the inclusion and exclusion criteria for subject selection? As a general rule, autism research studies should include all eligible participants and verify their diagnosis. However, in some circumstances, certain people might have to be excluded. For example, a study might want to look at the character - istics of boys and not girls. Sometimes individuals with other diagnoses such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety disorder, seizure disorder, psychosis, or other co-occurring disorders are specifically included or excluded, depending on the research question of a study or the specific segment of the population of individuals with autism the researchers want to better under- stand. Regardless, if the study excluded some possible participants, it should clearly state the reasons why they were excluded. How were the participants assigned to groups? If there is more than one group in the study, the methods section should explain how the participants were assigned to each group. Sound research studies “randomly assign” participants to groups. Random assignment is a lot like “flipping a coin,” meaning that each participant has an equally likely chance of being assigned to any one group. The purpose of random assignment is to guard against bias in assigning participants to a group, which might affect the outcome; that is, to ensure that there are no differences in the basic characteristics of partici- pants in any one group compared with those of any other group. Without such safeguards, the results might not be valid. Procedure The procedure section explains how the study was conducted. Important things to look for regarding how the research was conducted include: What steps did the researchers take to set up and complete the study? This section should give a fairly detailed explanation of the procedure used in the study, including the method of collecting data. The purpose of this section is to enable others to recreate the study exactly as conducted, given the necessary equipment or skill. 26 Life Journey Through Autism: A Parent’s Guide to Research"

The purpose of this section is to enable others to recreate the study exactly as conducted, given the necessary equipment or skill. 26 Life Journey Through Autism: A Parent’s Guide to Research What kinds of data were collected? The procedure section should also give specifics about what kinds of data were collected from the participants, such as measures of knowledge or behavior. A sound study collects sufficient data to test all the hypotheses or answer all of the research questions posed at the beginning of the study. Measures and Instruments This section should provide specific information about the instruments and measures used to collect the data. Specific points to look for in this section include: Do the instruments measure what they are supposed to measure? Researchers should discuss whether the instruments measure what they are sup - posed to measure. In research terminology, this is referred to as validity. Authors talk about validity in numerical terms, expressed as a decimal (e.g., .80). A per- fectly valid instrument will have a validity of 1.0. Generally, instruments above .75 are considered to have good validity. However, a lower score may be consid - ered acceptable if other studies have used the instrument successfully. Have other researchers used the instruments? Generally, instruments that have been used by other researchers have more cred - ibility than others. Authors should refer to other studies that have used the same instrument by citing the author and the date of publication of the study in the text. If it is a new measure, not used in other studies or created specifically for the study at hand, the authors should give a lot of detail about the measure, as well as an explanation for why it was chosen for use in their study. Results The results section explains the statistical analyses of the data conducted as part of the study, and presents the findings of the analyses in three formats: (1) nar - rative (written in text), (2) graphic (depicted in graphs/figures), and (3) tabular (presented in tables). Key points to look for in this section include: What are the findings of the study? Research studies use sophisticated statistical methods to evaluate their findings. The average layperson (and even some researchers!) may be unable to evaluate the more complex statistical methods used in conducting research.

    "recommendation": "strategy for evaluating the findings of a given study may be to get a general idea by looking at the tables and figures provided. The tables present the average or mean scores for each group on the measures used in the study. By looking at these scores, you can get a general idea of whether one group scored notably higher or lower than another. An example of a table pre- senting mean scores is provided below. The table tells us that the maximum score on the measures is 100. On the verbal skills test, the experimental group scored higher than the control group (82 vs. 71). The asterisk after this score shows that the difference is statistically significant. On the spatial skills test, the experimen- tal group again scored higher than the control group (70 vs. 68), but this difference is not as large and, therefore, is not statistically significant. (See the next section for more about statistical significance.) The figures present the same information as the tables, but in a graphic format (often figures are presented as bar graphs, as illustrated in Figure 1, or as line graphs as illustrated in Figure 2). By looking at the exhibits, the reader can see if there is a general pattern in terms of which group differs from another. Not all studies present the findings in both tabular and/or graphic formats. Therefore, sometimes readers will have to interpret the findings as best they can by reading the text. What do the findings mean? Differences in group scores do not necessarily indicate that the findings are sig - nificantly different. In research, the findings are considered meaningful only if they are “statistically significant.” Findings are considered statistically significant if the probability that the difference in scores is due to chance is less than 5%. In research studies, statistical significance is expressed in text as “p < .05” or “p < .01.” Note that being statistically significant does not automatically make the findings clinically significant. That is, the findings must be considered within the context of clinical norms. Mean Score Differences on Verbal and Spatial Skills Tests (Max. Score 100) Experimental Group Control Group Verbal Skills 82* 71 Spatial Skills 70 68 *p < .05. The discussion section explains the findings of the study in terms that are more easily understandable to the layperson than the results section. 28 Life Journey Through Autism: A Parent’s Guide to Research"

    "recommendation": "Discussion In the discussion section, researchers summarize the findings of the study, give their interpretation of the findings, and present their conclusions about the study. Key points to look for in this section include: How do the authors summarize their findings? The discussion section should begin with a summary of the findings. Most authors summarize the findings in the first paragraph of this section. How do the authors interpret the findings? The discussion section gives authors the most “flexibility” because the findings of a study are always open to interpretation. Authors usually present a very good argument for their conclusions about the findings of a study. What are the limitations of the study? In addition to presenting their conclusions about the findings, authors should also discuss the limitations of their study. For example, was it limited by a small number of participants, or to a specific setting? Are the findings applicable to different participants and other settings? Authors should also discuss whether or not the findings are applicable to different participants and other settings. This will depend on the characteristics of the par- ticipants used in the study and whether or not the setting is applicable to the real world or is limited to a laboratory setting. The researchers may end the discussion section by suggesting what research still needs to be done in order to answer the question more fully. References As stated previously, research does not occur in isolation. Authors conduct a liter- ature review of relevant studies before conducting a study and share their relevant findings in the background or introduction of the article. A literature review sum- marizes the existing body of published articles and other sources relevant to the It is important to bear in mind that the discussion section of an article reflects the authors’ own interpretation of the findings of the study. 29A Uniform Framework for Evaluating Research Studies study topic. It demonstrates the authors’ understanding of the research topic, and provides context for the purpose of their own study. In the references section of the article, the authors list all research studies that they cited in the article. If you want to look up a reference to learn more, you can search the author’s name or study title in an online database. Beware of a Conflict of Interest As an educated consumer of information, it is important to be aware that research- ers are sometimes influenced by a “conflict of interest.” For example, drug companies may offer funding to researchers to conduct studies testing their prod- ucts. And, because their research is dependent on the company for funding, researchers can be under pressure to find evidence that supports the use of these products. Conversely, negative results may be suppressed. Therefore, it is always wise to investigate the source of funding behind the research. In most professional research articles, authors acknowledge their source of funding by referencing the funding agency and grant number, where applicable, either on the first page or right before the reference section at the end of an article. How to Scan for Research Articles If you have limited time to read a full research study, reading the article’s abstract will provide you with a synopsis of the key points of the study and allow you to determine whether to read further. If it looks interesting, scan the methods section to learn more about the participants in the study to see how many there were, if they share characteristics (e.g., age, gender, verbal ability) with the population in which you are interested, and who implemented the intervention in the study (e.g., parents, teachers, researchers, clinicians). This will help you determine the extent to which you can relate the study’s findings to your own questions. Finally, as mentioned, most studies include a limitations section at the end (before the reference list). This is a helpful section to read because this is where the researchers point out any aspects of the study that you should be cau - tious about. No research study is perfect, so a thoughtfully written limitations section can help you understand the weaknesses of the study and balance that with its strengths. 30 Life Journey Through Autism: A Parent’s Guide to Research"

Don’t be afraid to assess the merit of a study based on your own common sense. Always bear in mind that you are your child’s most important advocate, and if you have any misgivings and questions about a given study, remember that there are many knowledgeable parents and professionals in the autism community with whom you can discuss your concerns. Scientific progress occurs slowly over time. It is not represented by a single study, but by a large body of research. Each study builds on prior studies. New theoretical frameworks, methods, and statistical analyses are developed. Over time, typically decades, the findings converge on points of agreement.

    "recommendation": "Intervention: A treatment or program that is designed to change the targeted behavior, perception, or condition of the participants. Manipulation: Occurs in an experiment, when a researcher does something to one variable to see if it affects another variable. Mean: The average score for a group of participants. Meta-analysis: A statistical analysis of findings from multiple research studies. Participant expectations: Results that people expect to happen when they partici- pate in a research study. Peer review: Articles submitted to academic and scientific journals are generally reviewed by a committee of peers (other researchers in the field) for scientific merit and accuracy before appearing in a journal. Placebo: A pretend treatment that participants believe is the real treatment, such as a sugar pill. Random assignment: A method similar to “flipping a coin” used to assign partici- pants in a study to be in either an experimental or a control group so that they have an equal chance of being in either group. Reliable: In research, something is considered to be reliable if it produces similar results when tested at different times. Research-based: Interventions or practices that have theory-based foundations, but do not have cumulative evidence of effectiveness from multiple independent, rigorous research studies. Researcher expectations : Results that researchers expect to happen when they conduct a research study. Self-selected: Participants in research are considered “self-selecting” when they volunteer to participate in a study. Statistically significant: The results of a study are considered “statistically signifi- cant” when the probability that they are due to chance is less than 5%. Subject: Someone who participates in a study. Systemic review: A detailed, unbiased synthesis of related research studies that answer a well-defined research question. 34 Life Journey Through Autism: A Parent’s Guide to Research Validity: In research, the quality of being factually sound—that something is what it is supposed to be, and not something that it should not be. Variables: The thing or things that are being studied. 35Glossary of Research Terms"

The appendix is not meant to be comprehensive, and does not capture the complete range of topics nor breadth of each topic. Further information may be found under Recommended Readings on page 39. Causes of Autism Everyone inherits certain traits from their parents. Genes are the biological mech- anism through which we inherit these traits. At the same time, environmental factors may influence how these biological traits are expressed. This complex inter- play between our genes and our environment is known among researchers as the “nature versus nurture debate.” We have begun to make technological advances in the 21st century that allow us to conduct sophisticated genetic research studies. For example, researchers have conducted studies that will help us understand the complex interplay between genes and the environment in determining the symp - toms of autism. Knowing the specific underlying causes of autism may ultimately allow interventions to be targeted specifically to individuals with certain genetic or biological traits. Some parents suspect the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine causes the onset of autism. This is likely due to the fact that their first awareness of symptoms is in the second year of life when signs of autism (e.g. significant regression of social behaviors) typically emerge—around the same time chil- dren receive the vaccine. However, studies have failed to show a causal link between vaccines and autism. In fact, studies have demonstrated the absence of such a causal relationship. In addition, there is considerable evidence that there are differences in brain development that lead to autism prior to birth. Early Diagnosis Recent studies have shown that screening tools can be used to detect early indi - cators of autism in infants as young as 12-18 months of age; yet, the majority of children continue to remain undiagnosed until 3-4 years of age if not longer.

Several factors contribute to this delay, including clinicians having limited understanding 45Appendix A: Current State of Autism Research of the early manifestations of autism, lack of universal screening of toddlers for autism, and lack of resources. To help prevent, or shorten, this critical delay, national initiatives have been launched, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) “Learn the Signs. Act Early.” Program, designed to pro- mote awareness about the early signs of autism with the goal of enrolling children in intervention as early as possible. Early Intervention Closely related to early diagnosis is early intervention. Prompt educational inter- vention is key to helping children with autism learn the skills needed for self-care, school success, and community functioning. Research suggests that early inter - vention is critical to improving the quality of life and long-term outcomes for children with autism. In the past, early intervention studies were generally conducted in clinical settings. However, now there is substantial research evidence supporting more “naturalistic” behavioral interventions that are applied in home or school settings within a child’s daily routines. That is, instead of therapists implementing inter - ventions, research supports coaching parents to implement intervention strategies so that children can receive support throughout the week instead of just during therapy sessions. As a result, early intervention studies are now being conducted with infants and toddlers. Educating Children With Autism Children with autism are educated in a variety of educational environments ranging from specialized schools and classrooms to full integration with their neurotypical peers. Integrated settings offer many social and educational advan - tages for children with autism; however, careful instructional planning is critical to ensure success among all students in the inclusive classroom. To that end, stud- ies are being conducted in classrooms to evaluate the effectiveness of programs that aim to improve academic, social, behavioral, communication, and executive functioning skills of students with autism across a variety of educational settings. In 2015, the National Center for Special Education Research (NCSER) published a comprehensive summary of autism research that includes an overview of the ongoing and complete research studies to date.

A well-developed and implemented transition plan is critical to ensuring children are prepared to live and work independently beyond high school. Many transition, postsecondary, and vocational programs have surfaced to help individuals with autism and other disabilities adapt to and succeed in higher education settings. Further research is needed to examine the characteristics and effectiveness of these programs in community colleges and universities, and to help guide program developers, service providers, and policymakers. Demographic Factors There are many demographic factors to consider, such as race, ethnicity, socio - economic status, geographic region, parent education, and sex. Studies in autism were previously limited by small samples restricted to a certain geographic area and participation of primarily middle- to high-income white families. Now, multi- site studies and national research registries allow researchers to examine group differences in large and diverse samples. Looking at differences in how effective an intervention is based on these demographic factors can have significant impli - cations for determining which interventions best serve a given individual. Health and Safety Individuals with autism have greater physical health and safety concerns than the general population, ranging from obesity and gastrointestinal issues to self-harm and being victims of sexual assault. They also experience greater mental health challenges. For example, more than half of adults with autism have a co-occurring psychiatric condition—often a mood or anxiety disorder. Further, individuals with autism are at high risk of engaging in suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Little information is available on the topic of suicidality, and researchers have only begun to investigate the issue. Employment Adults with autism experience high rates of unemployment; indeed, even those who complete college and receive vocational rehabilitation services are under- or unemployed. With the appropriate training and support, persons with autism can and should be employed. To this end, research is needed regarding issues such as how best to assess “job match,” how to best identify and address barriers to mean- ingful employment, what employer variables are associated with more positive employment outcomes, and to what extent coworker training is integral to success in workplace settings for individuals with autism. 47Appendix A: Current State of Autism Research"

However, although the symptoms of autism do not end when children reach adulthood, many federally mandated transition and sup- port services do, leading to what many parents describe as seeing their children “fall off a services cliff.” For example, studies consistently show that adults with autism experience social isolation and difficulty accessing disability services. As a result, there has been an increased research emphasis on determining the most effective ways to prepare students for their transition from school to adult services. Most individuals with autism require some degree of support throughout their lives. The intensity of such care will vary from person to person: It may range from 24-hour supervision to monthly case management. In general, families often play the essential role of providing caregiver supports across the lifespan. To date, little systematic research has been published on the types of housing options available for adults with autism. Some argue that community-based hous- ing leads to increased community participation and independence and, therefore, is preferable to so-called intentional communities or larger care settings. However, to date, there is limited data to indicate which housing options work best for indi- viduals with autism. Further research is needed to determine the best housing fit and the factors that lead to increased community engagement and overall quality of life for adults with autism. Technology The past several decades have witnessed an exponential growth in new technolo- gies. Some of these advanced tools may be used to better understand and support individuals with autism. For example, researchers use affordable, GPS-enabled fitness watches to measure, monitor, and understand health and behavior related to physical activity, sleep, travel, and community engagement. For-profit busi - nesses are teaming up with researchers to develop and market commercially viable technological products for individuals with autism. These range from online education training programs to apps that use computer vision analysis for early autism detection and monitoring. Especially given the speed with which new technologies emerge, it is important to conduct research that systematically reviews and determines the efficacy of these varied technologies. Individual Quality-of-Life Assessment Only in the past decade or so have autism researchers and practitioners begun to actively address the issue of quality of life for adolescents and adults with autism.

Will I learn more about my child from participating in a study? A. Be sure you understand the purpose of a study. Generally, research studies are conducted to collect group data, so you will probably not receive any information specific to your child as an individual. Q. How can I be sure that it is safe for my child to participate in a study? A. Inquire about the ethical review process that the study had to undergo before it was approved to be conducted. Be sure that the research is being carried out in a controlled environment that is committed to the protection of participants’ rights. Generally, studies conducted at universities and medical institutions must receive prior approval from institutional review boards, whose job it is to make sure that the research is ethical and safe. Private facilities are not always as closely regulated, so be sure to inquire about their systems of review and safeguards, if relevant. In addition, you should also inquire about what tests, medications, or procedures are involved for your child and other family members. Q. How can I be sure that the study will not demand too much of my time? A. Be sure you understand the requirements of participation. Find out how long the study is expected to last and how much time you will have to com- mit: Will you have to participate on a daily or weekly basis? How many hours per day are required?, etc. Q. If the study is using a randomized control design, how will I know if my child is in the control or the treatment group? A.

A one-year diary revealed seasonal changes in sleep patterns. The results are discussed in terms of their application to future research. Introduction Parents often report sleep problems in children with autism (Callahan, 2016; Rogers & Brown, 2016). Moreover, research reveals that problems in sleep may be affected by seasonal changes (Robins, Williams, Jones, & Miller, 2015). However, to date there have been no studies investigating the relationship between seasonal changes and sleep patterns in children with autism. [ Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to examine whether the sleep patterns of a child with autism were affected by seasonal changes.] Often a research question will be expressed in the form of a statement on the purpose of the study. previous research cited previous research cited 55Appendix C: Sample Research Articles"

They were evaluated for ASD using a standardized parent interview (Smith, 1995) and the Behavioral Rating Scales (Jones & Harper, 1989). The children who received a clinical diagnosis of ASD were re-evaluated one year later to determine if they still met the diagnostic criteria of ASD.

Introduction Recently, there has been a movement towards early diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (Aaron, King, & Farquire, 2015).

However, some child development specialists fear that a diagnosis of autism made before the age of 3 years old may be premature and that children diagnosed before the age of 3 may not meet the same diagnostic criteria after age 3 (Howell, Musselman, Treman et al., 2017).

[ It was predicted that, compared with the control group, children who received the intervention would demonstrate a significant decrease in negative behavior following intervention.] Method Subjects The subjects were 38 children with autism between the ages of 3 and 5 years old. There were 32 boys and 6 girls—31 Caucasian, 4 African American, 1 Asian, and 2 Hispanic. Procedure Four schools were randomly assigned to receive either the intervention or no inter- vention; two schools were assigned to the experimental group and two schools were assigned to the control group. The experimental group included 22 children, and the control group included 16 children. The intervention consisted of group exercises in correcting negative behavior, conducted every day for three weeks. The control group received no exercises (“business-as-usual”). Research assistants were trained to make observational assessments of neg - ative behavior. Baseline observational measures of negative behavior were recorded prior to the intervention for the experimental group and on the same day for the control group. These same measures were recorded for the experi - mental group at a one-week post-intervention followup assessment and on the same day for the control group.

There were 32 boys and 6 girls—31 Caucasian, 4 African American, 1 Asian, and 2 Hispanic. Procedure Four schools were randomly assigned to receive either the intervention or no inter- vention; two schools were assigned to the experimental group and two schools were assigned to the control group. The experimental group included 22 children, and the control group included 16 children. The intervention consisted of group exercises in correcting negative behavior, conducted every day for three weeks. The control group received no exercises (“business-as-usual”). Research assistants were trained to make observational assessments of neg - ative behavior. Baseline observational measures of negative behavior were recorded prior to the intervention for the experimental group and on the same day for the control group.

Although more children in the experimental group demonstrated improvement in their symptoms than the children taking a placebo, the differences were not significant. Future research is needed to further investigate the effects of this drug. Introduction Many psychotropic drugs have been tested for their efficacy in treating the symp- toms of autism (e.g., Tucker, Jones, & Martin, 2019; Vanelli, 2018). However, to date, none has proven to be effective for the majority of children with autism. The purpose of the present study was to test the efficacy of a new drug for treating the symptoms of autism. [It was predicted that, compared with children who received a placebo, children who received the new drug would demonstrate significant improvements in their symptoms of autism.] Method Subjects The subjects were 24 children with autism between the ages of 5 and 8 years old. There were 21 boys and 3 girls of mixed racial background. Specific hypothesis 67Appendix C: Sample Research Articles"

Psychologists assessed autism symptomology at baseline (prior to the children receiving the drug), after six weeks of treatment, and at a one-month followup assessment. Results Repeated-measures ANOVAs revealed no significant between-group difference at any of the times of assessment: pretest (F = 2.78, p > .05); six weeks (F = 3.23, p > .05); and followup (F= 3.56, p > .05).

Consider … Most studies specify “randomized” in the title, abstract, and methods section if this is true. 78 Life Journey Through Autism: A Parent’s Guide to Research Randomized trials are more rigorous than quasi-experimental (where there is a control group that is not randomly assigned but may be matched on things like age or gender) studies because they make sure groups are equal before starting the intervention. Interpret non- randomized trials with caution. 6. Were the groups of children similar at the start of the intervention? Consider … If the trial is randomized, the groups were similar at the start of the trial. If the trial is not randomized, were the groups matched on key char - acteristics like age, sex, or cognitive level? Were there any important differences between groups? If so, interpret results with caution because treatment differences may be due to differences between the groups rather than the intervention itself. 7. Were the groups of children treated the same except for the intervention/ treatment? Consider … If there were differences in how groups were treated besides the inter- vention, you won’t know if changes from pre to post are due to the intervention or something else. Interpret these results with caution. Children are usually in educational programs and are constantly learning and changing. It is also unethical to ask families to stop all other interventions to be in a research study. For these reasons, often the control group is called “business as usual” or “services as usual.” Sometimes two treatments are compared. One group gets Treatment A and the other gets Treatment B. These studies only tell you if one treatment is more effective than the other. They do not tell you if either intervention is more effective than no intervention. To know if changes are more than developmental, there has to be a control group getting no intervention or “services as usual.” 8. Were reliable and valid measures used to determine treatment effect? Consider … Did the tests/measures actually measure the target outcome? For example, if the intended outcome of the treatment is attention, did the researchers measure the children’s attention at pre- to post-intervention? Were the measures reliable and valid? Do the researchers use “stan- dardized” measures or report things like the internal consistency (ideally > .75) of the measures? If the researchers used an observational or “coding” system, did they collect reliability data on that measure? Ideally > .80. 79Appendix D: Sample Worksheets"
